# 85-Confucian Breeze Brushing the Scroll: Traditional Humanistic Spirit in Puhui New Year Pictures

In its development and thematic expression, Gaomi Puhui New Year Picture is deeply imprinted with the humanistic spirit of traditional Chinese Confucian culture. Artists consciously or unconsciously integrate the core concepts of Confucian thought into their creations, making New Year Pictures a carrier for transmitting moral ethics and cultural values.

**The Aesthetic Pursuit of "Hui Shi Hou Su" (Painting Comes After Plainness)**:
Puhui New Year Picture, especially the "Old Mo Painting" series, with its concise and ethereal composition and reduced-stroke freehand modeling, has similarities with the aesthetic viewpoint of "Hui Shi Hou Su" advocated by Confucius. It pursues a simple and benevolent artistic realm, closely combining beauty and goodness, and embodying the Confucian ideal of "尽善尽美" (perfect goodness and perfect beauty) through the unity of simple modeling and color, form and content.

**Vivid Interpretation of "Loyalty and Filial Piety Culture"**:
"Loyalty" and "filial piety" are the core of Confucian ethics. Gaomi Puhui New Year Picture has a large number of themes that promote the concepts of loyalty and filial piety.
*   **Filial Piety First**: For example, "Five Sons Offering Longevity" expresses the wish for the elder's well-being and longevity, advocating respect for the elderly. "Twenty-Four Filial Exemplars" further illustrates historically famous acts of filial piety, becoming an intuitive teaching material for educating children to be filial, and its educational significance far exceeds its simple viewing value.
*   **Loyalty and Righteousness Passed Down**: For example, the image of Guan Yu in "God of Wealth" represents the spirit of loyalty, righteousness, and courage, and is deeply respected by the people.

**Ideal Picture of "Harmony and Benevolence"**:
Confucianism emphasizes "harmony is precious" and focuses on harmonious interpersonal relationships and social stability. Puhui New Year Picture also expresses this ideal through numerous themes.
*   **Family Harmony**: For example, "Pomegranate Opening a Hundred Sons" and "Hoping the Son Becomes a Dragon" express the hope for flourishing descendants and a happy family. "Sisters-in-Law Chatting" depicts the close harmony between sisters-in-law, and "Mother and Son Affection" shows warm parental love.
*   **Social Education**: Through the depiction of historical stories and opera characters, moral principles such as benevolence, righteousness, and trustworthiness are subtly transmitted.

Through the artistic presentation of core Confucian values such as "loyalty and filial piety," "benevolence," and "harmony," Gaomi Puhui New Year Picture not only beautifies people's lives but also subtly plays a social role of "成教化，助人伦" (achieving education and assisting human relations), becoming an important part of the folk spiritual and cultural life in the agricultural era.
