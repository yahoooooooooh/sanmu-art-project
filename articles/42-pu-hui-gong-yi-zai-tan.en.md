# 42-Revisiting the "Puhui" Craft: From "Mo Huazi" to the Secrets of Clear Oil

Regarding the core "Puhui" craft of Gaomi Puhui New Year Painting, Zheng Jun provides a more vivid and detailed supplementary description in his article, allowing us to gain a deeper understanding of this technique.

Firstly, folk artists colloquially call Puhui New Year Painting **"Mo Huazi"** because their entire set of techniques carries the meaning of "smearing." This name vividly summarizes the characteristic actions of smearing, brushing, and sweeping during the drawing process.

After sketching and pouncing the ash, an important step in the process is **"Repouncing"**. To increase the number of prints, artists will retrace the outline on a pounced draft with willow branch charcoal sticks and then pounce again. This step effectively improves the utilization rate of the draft.

After completing the main steps such as pouncing ash, applying color, outlining, drawing eyebrows and eyes, and washing flowers, an indispensable finishing step is **applying clear oil**. Literature explicitly states that the main components of this layer of clear oil can be **alcoholic rosin liquid, egg white, or bone glue**. Applying clear oil not only protects the painting and increases gloss but also makes the colors brighter and more durable. In early Puhui New Year paintings, applying white powder and clear oil were essential steps, but unfortunately, modern Puhui New Year paintings pay less attention to these two points.

These supplementary details show us that "Puhui" is not just a simple sketching method but a complete and unique system of folk craftsmanship that includes material processing, multiple replication, meticulous drawing, and final surface treatment.
