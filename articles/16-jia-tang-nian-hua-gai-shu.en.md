# 16-"Family Shrine": A Unique Ancestral Worship Monument in Gaomi Puhui New Year Paintings

Among the numerous themes of Gaomi Puhui New Year paintings, the "Family Shrine" (Jia Tang) painting is undoubtedly one of the most representative with local characteristics. It is not only a treasure of folk art but also a visual carrier bearing profound folk culture and family emotions.

So, what is a "Family Shrine"?

The term "Family Shrine" originally referred to the main hall of a house, especially the building where ancestral tablets were placed. In later contexts, it often also referred to the ancestral tablets themselves. In the context of Gaomi Puhui New Year paintings, "Family Shrine" specifically refers to a type of New Year painting used exclusively for worshipping ancestors during the New Year.

This theme of New Year painting is extremely rare nationwide. Judging from existing materials, it seems that only the Gaomi City area in Shandong Province has this type of Puhui New Year painting with "Family Shrine" as its theme. Its uniqueness and importance also make it a significant entry point for studying Gaomi's folk culture and New Year painting art. On May 20, 2006, Gaomi Puhui New Year paintings, including "Family Shrine," were approved by the State Council to be included in the first batch of national intangible cultural heritage list, highlighting its value.

The visual art of "Family Shrine" paintings carries rich cultural information and formative principles. In-depth research on it is of great significance for the inheritance and development of this unique folk culture.
