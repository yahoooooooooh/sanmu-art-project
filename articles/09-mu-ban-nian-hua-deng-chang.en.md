# 09-A New Attempt Driven by Efficiency: The Emergence and Popularization of Woodblock New Year Pictures in the Late Qing Dynasty

In the development history of Gaomi New Year Pictures, besides the pure Puhui technique and the integrative "half-printed, half-painted" method, a form more focused on production efficiency and market popularization also emerged â€“ woodblock New Year Pictures.

This change occurred in the late Qing Dynasty. At that time, some New Year picture shops and workshops, in order to further "improve economic benefits," explored and adopted the "full-color overprinting" method on the basis of existing Puhui New Year Pictures and half-printed, half-painted New Year Pictures. This was the origin of Gaomi woodblock New Year Pictures.

Unlike "half-printed, half-painted" where woodblocks were only used to print line contours, full-color overprinted woodblock New Year Pictures meant that the various color blocks of the image were also printed by separately carved woodblocks in successive color applications. This technological advancement greatly improved the production efficiency of New Year pictures, correspondingly reduced costs, and thus created conditions for larger-scale popularization.

Literature clearly states: "Woodblock New Year Pictures began to enter thousands of households." This indicates that the emergence of woodblock New Year Pictures allowed this art form, originally with more handicraft characteristics, to enter ordinary people's homes with a more accessible posture and wider coverage, becoming an indispensable decoration and blessing during the New Year festival.

Although this form may have reduced the uniqueness of hand-painting to some extent, it undoubtedly played an important role in promoting the popularization of New Year pictures and meeting mass cultural demands, and it is also a manifestation of the market-oriented operation of Gaomi New Year Pictures in a specific historical period.
