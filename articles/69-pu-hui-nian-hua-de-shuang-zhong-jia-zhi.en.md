# 69-The Dual Value of Puhui New Year Pictures: The Fusion of Culture and Economy

Gaomi Puhui New Year Pictures, as an original regional cultural feature, exhibit significant dual value from the perspective of contemporary economic and cultural development: namely, cultural value and economic value.

**Cultural Value**: Puhui New Year Pictures are a rare type of folk art in the large family of Chinese New Year Pictures that has been completely hand-painted and passed down to this day. It is a gem of Chinese folk art. It carries rich historical and cultural information and is a true reflection of the spiritual life of the common people in the Gaomi region during the agricultural era and a carrier of folk customs. It profoundly reflects their original spiritual homeland. Research on the artistry of Puhui New Year Pictures and the excavation of its cultural significance are helpful in solving the problems of its inheritance and protection as an intangible cultural heritage item.

**Economic Value**: With the increasing attention and support from local governments towards folk arts, Gaomi Puhui New Year Pictures have become a characteristic folk tourism product. Through organizing folk art festivals, establishing folk museums, and supporting artists' creations, the economic benefits brought by Puhui New Year Pictures are becoming increasingly evident, injecting vitality into the development of the local cultural tourism industry.
