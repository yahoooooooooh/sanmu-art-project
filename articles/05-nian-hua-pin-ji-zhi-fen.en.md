# 05-Standard Goods, Fine Work, and Masterpieces: Understanding the Grade Distinctions of Gaomi Puhui New Year Pictures

When appreciating or purchasing Gaomi Puhui New Year Pictures, you may hear terms like "standard goods" (行货), "fine work" (细活), and "masterpieces" (精品). These are not arbitrary labels but rather grade classifications of Puhui New Year Pictures based on different market demands and artistic standards.

The existence of this classification is primarily to "cater to the market and meet people's needs." New Year pictures of different grades vary in terms of the fineness of painting, hours invested, materials used, and even creative innovation:

*   **Standard Goods (行货)**: Usually refers to more common, relatively mass-produced, and more affordably priced New Year pictures. They primarily fulfill the function of New Year pictures as festive decorations and folk items.
*   **Fine Work (细活)**: Compared to standard goods, fine work is more meticulously painted, with more exquisite handling of lines and colors, and enhanced artistic quality.
*   **Masterpieces (精品)**: Represent the highest artistic level of Gaomi Puhui New Year Pictures. Literature mentions that "many New Year picture artists are creating masterpieces, no longer rigidly adhering to traditional painting drafts, and starting to create some new works." These masterpieces not only strive for innovation in painting techniques but also draw on the essence of traditional Chinese painting in composition and technique, aiming to elevate Puhui New Year Pictures to a higher artistic realm. Therefore, the price of masterpiece paintings is usually several times higher than that of commercial paintings (standard goods and fine work can be considered commercial paintings in a broad sense).

This grade classification reflects both the New Year picture artists' flexible adaptation to market demands and their relentless pursuit of artistic innovation.
