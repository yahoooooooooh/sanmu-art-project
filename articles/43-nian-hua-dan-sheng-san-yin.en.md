# 43-Exploring the Origin of Gaomi Puhui New Year Painting: Livelihood, Utility, and Aesthetics

The birth of Gaomi Puhui New Year Painting, a unique art form, was not accidental but the result of multiple factors working together under specific social and historical conditions. Scholar Zheng Jun believes its formation mainly originated from the following three aspects:

1.  **Livelihood Needs**: This is the most direct and primitive motivation. Initially, some folk artists would copy some literati paintings or temple murals to sell in the market to make a living. In long-term practice, they gradually borrowed, absorbed, and innovated on these copies, slowly giving rise to the earliest Puhui New Year Paintings. This market-oriented creation is the economic basis for the production and development of Puhui New Year Painting.

2.  **Practical Function**: In its early stages, the themes and content of Puhui New Year Painting had strong practical relevance. Most works were mainly of deity images and ink screen flower-and-bird paintings. For example, various deity images (such as Kitchen God, God of Wealth, Door Gods, etc.) were posted by every household during the Spring Festival. This originated from folk religious beliefs and prayer customs. People regarded them as the protectors of the family throughout the year, hoping they would bring peace and good fortune. This strong practical demand provided a broad market space for Puhui New Year Painting.

3.  **Aesthetic Consolation**: In addition to religious and prayer functions, the content of Puhui New Year Painting also often depicted small scenes from daily life, vividly reflecting the local customs and lifestyle of the people. For ordinary folks who had worked hard all day, in their leisure time, appreciating the brightly colored and familiar New Year paintings hanging on the wall was undoubtedly a spiritual relaxation and pleasure, allowing their "mood to naturally become much lighter." This aesthetic need gave Puhui New Year Painting artistic value and emotional consolation function beyond its practical utility.

It is the intertwining and driving force of these three factors that together gave birth to and nourished Gaomi Puhui New Year Painting, a treasure of folk art.
