# 81-The Aesthetic Implication of Puhui New Year Pictures: The Folk Cultural Code for Praying for Blessings and Good Fortune

Gaomi Puhui New Year Picture, as a folk art form rooted in the agricultural era, its aesthetic implication is first reflected in its role as a vivid carrier of the core folk cultural concept of "praying for blessings and good fortune." It is not just visual art, but also a code to interpret the spiritual world and collective consciousness of the people in the Gaomi area during a specific historical period.

**Artistic Recreation of Folk Customs**:
The themes of Puhui New Year Pictures are closely linked to local folk customs. Whether it's weddings, funerals, seasonal festivals, daily life, or religious beliefs, corresponding artistic expressions can be found in the New Year pictures. Artists, centered around the theme of "New Year," create works like "God of Wealth," "Good Fortune as You Wish," and "He He Er Xian" (Two Immortals of Harmony) to seek blessings; depict the yearning for a better life through works like "Round Fan Beauty," "Sisters-in-Law Chatting," and "Mother and Son"; convey educational concepts through works like "Five Sons Vying for First Place," "Mother San Teaching Her Son," and "Twenty-Four Filial Exemplars"; satisfy entertainment needs with opera stories like "Zhou Yu Beating Huang Gai" and "Yan Qing Selling Threads"; and beautify the home environment with flowers, birds, insects, fish, plum blossoms, orchids, bamboos, and chrysanthemums.

**Widespread Use of Symbolism and Meaning**:
Artists skillfully use symbolism, metaphor, and homophones to integrate people's wishes into the pictures. For example:
*   A fat baby holding a carp symbolizes "nian nian you yu" (abundance year after year).
*   Pomegranate symbolizes "liu kai bai zi" (many children and many blessings).
*   Peony symbolizes "wealth and prosperity."
*   Bat symbolizes "blessings" (f√∫).

These visual symbols directly express the simple desires of ordinary people for a good life, including happiness, wealth, longevity, and prosperity of descendants.

**Unity of Practicality and Spiritual Comfort**:
The concept of praying for blessings and good fortune carried by Puhui New Year Pictures has a strong practical aspect, such as sacrificing to ancestors for protection and offering to the God of Wealth for abundant income. However, when these practical wishes are spiritually satisfied through the aesthetic form of the New Year picture, they can transform into the optimistic spirit and inner strength of the people facing real life and overcoming difficulties.

Therefore, the aesthetic implication of Gaomi Puhui New Year Pictures is deeply rooted in its cultural core of praying for blessings and good fortune. It is both an artistic reflection of folk life and a concrete manifestation of people's spiritual sustenance.
