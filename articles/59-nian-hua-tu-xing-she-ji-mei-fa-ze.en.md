# 59-Analysis of the Application of Formal Beauty Principles in the Visual Graphics of Poku Hui New Year Paintings

Gao Mi Poku Hui New Year Paintings, as a unique visual art form, consciously or unconsciously apply various formal beauty principles in its graphic design, layout, and composition, thereby giving the works unique aesthetic value. In his research, Wen Xin analyzed the embodiment of these formal beauty principles in Poku Hui New Year Paintings.

**Basic Concepts of Formal Beauty**:
Formal beauty refers to the beauty possessed by various formal elements (such as color, line, form, etc.) and their regular combinations in nature, life, and art. It has a relatively independent aesthetic significance, summarizes some common characteristics of beautiful forms, and has a certain abstractness. The content it embodies is often indirect and vague, and it is closely related to the material attributes and laws of nature.

**Embodiment of Formal Beauty Principles in Poku Hui New Year Paintings**:

1.  **Simplicity and Uniformity**: Refers to the sense of purity brought by simple colors and neat and orderly forms. In Poku Hui New Year Paintings, this principle often does not exist in isolation but is combined with other principles. For example, in the semi-printed and semi-painted work "Nezha Conquering the Sea" (Figure 3-4), the small mythical story picture is regular and uniform, with simple but varied use of color, making it unique.

2.  **Symmetry and Balance**:
    *   **Symmetry**: Brings a sense of seriousness and respect. Symmetry is often used in the composition of themes such as deities and holy figures (as shown in Figure 3-5 "Civil God of Wealth") and works like "Family Shrine" and "Clan Portrait". Door paintings also often appear as symmetrical pairs.
    *   **Balance**: Makes the composition dynamic. The forms do not have to be exactly the same, but the sense of volume is roughly equivalent, giving a feeling of freedom. It is used more in themes of real life and opera stories. As shown in Figure 3-6 "Kicking Shuttlecock," the figures have large movements, but the overall center of gravity is stable, and symmetry is also contained within the pair of paintings.

3.  **Harmony and Contrast**: This is the unity of contradictions. In Poku Hui New Year Paintings, in addition to the combination of movement and stillness, and the unity of size in composition and layout (such as the size contrast of figures in "Civil God of Wealth"), it is mainly reflected in the use of color. From the early single tone mainly based on ink screen flowers, to the emergence of "red goods" after absorbing foreign elements, the colors became bright and festive, using contrasting and complementary colors, but through appropriate proportions and intermediate tones, the picture is naturally harmonious. Festive themes such as "Liu Hai Teasing the Golden Toad," "Pomegranate Opening to a Hundred Sons and Lotus Giving Birth to Noble Children" (Figure 3-7), "Gold and Jade Full House" (Figure 3-8), etc., have bright and full colors, which are very visually striking.

4.  **Proportion**: Refers to the relationship between the whole and the parts, and between parts and parts. As a folk art, the exaggeration of proportion in some works of Poku Hui New Year Paintings is for the need of artistic expression.
    *   Deity themes: Status is often reflected by the size contrast of figures.
    *   Chubby babies: The head is significantly larger to show cuteness.
    *   General figures: To pursue the freehand brushwork effect, the human body proportion is not a standard model, such as in "Two Beauties" (Figure 3-9), where the women have large heads and light bodies to show gracefulness.
    *   Color proportion: In the early stage, ink wash was the main color, and in the mature stage, colors are rich (red, green, yellow, purple, etc.). By adjusting the proportion of different colors, different tones are produced.

5.  **Rhythm and Rhyme**: Increases the aesthetic interest and emotional color of the work. Deity themes such as "Three Stars Picture" (Figure 3-10) have a full composition, harmonious rhythm of figure positions, steady yet lively. Flower themes such as "Matching Axis" (Figure 3-11) create a sense of rhythm and rhyme through the density, size, and color lightness and heaviness of flowers, branches, and leaves, making the picture bright and eye-catching without being stiff.

6.  **Unity in Variety (Harmony)**: The advanced form of formal beauty principles, reflected in the harmony of the overall composition and layout of the entire painting and the unity between the constituent parts. For example, Lv Zhenli's "Five Sons Offering Longevity" (Figure 3-12), the figures have different movements and expressions, and the colors are rich, but the overall visual effect is fresh and natural, clean and elegant, and the picture is rich and stable, which is a model of unity in variety.

The comprehensive application of these formal beauty principles constitutes the unique visual charm of Gao Mi Poku Hui New Year Paintings.
