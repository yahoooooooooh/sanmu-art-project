# 54-Driven by Spring Festival Customs: Market Demand and Diversified Posting of Poku Hui New Year Paintings

The Spring Festival, as the most important traditional festival in China, provides a strong market driving force for the creation and prosperity of Gao Mi Poku Hui New Year Paintings with its rich folk customs. In his research, Wen Xin elaborated on how the Spring Festival customs in the Gao Mi area generated a huge demand for various types of New Year paintings.

**The Long Cycle of Spring Festival and the Continuous Demand for New Year Paintings**:
In the folk customs of Gao Mi, the atmosphere of "celebrating the New Year" begins to permeate from "Laba" (the eighth day of the twelfth lunar month). People go to fairs, prepare New Year goods, until the "Cizao Day" (Kitchen God Festival) on the twenty-third or twenty-fourth day of the twelfth lunar month, when the demand for Kitchen God paintings reaches its peak. Every household buys "Zaoma Tou" (a type of woodblock printed Kitchen God image, Figure 1-5), and on the evening of "Xiao Nian" (Little New Year), they burn the line-engraved riding Kitchen God at the top with incense, symbolizing "reporting good deeds to heaven and ensuring peace on earth," while the solar terms table is pasted behind the door of the elderly's bedroom, and the Kitchen God image is pasted above the stove. Since the Kitchen God image is mainly used during specific solar terms and cannot be used again after the festival, woodblock printing, which has large output and low price, is mostly used. Hand-painted Poku Hui New Year painting-style Kitchen God images are almost unseen today.

On the day of "New Year's Eve," pasting door gods, pasting Spring Festival couplets, and setting off firecrackers become core customs. Therefore, door god paintings become indispensable items during the Spring Festival, with huge sales. In addition to door gods, New Year paintings used to commemorate ancestors, such as "Family Shrine" and "Clan Portrait" (Figure 1-6), also need to be hung on New Year's Eve.

**Nine Categories of New Year Painting Posting and Folk Significance**:
The location and selection of posting Gao Mi Poku Hui New Year Paintings have very detailed rules, reflecting different folk meanings. Wen Xin summarized nine main posting methods (which are basically consistent with the classification in the articles by Ge Hanqing and Ouyang Jubo, but re-emphasized from another researcher's perspective, still having its value):
1.  **Door Paintings**: Pasted on different doors according to the owner's identity and status.
2.  **Table Skirts**: Decorations in front of the offering table during festivals, mostly using auspicious patterns such as "Shou" (longevity) characters, "Pan Chang" (endless knot), etc., showing respect to ancestors or deities, and appearing neat and beautiful.
3.  **Window Paintings**: Pasted around windows with flowers, etc., for decoration and borrowing scenery effect.
4.  **Large Hangings**: Paintings about three feet long, mostly hung in women's rooms, such as "Mother and Child Picture" (Figure 1-7), reflecting blessings for wife and children.
5.  **Kang Head Paintings**: Pasted at the head of the kang (heated brick bed), themes are mostly chubby babies, opera stories (such as "Yellow Crane Tower," "Abundance Every Year" in Figure 1-7), with profound content or bright colors, symbolizing auspiciousness.
6.  **Table Head**: Hung in idle rooms, mainly for decorative purposes, such as the flower series works (Figure 1-8).
7.  **Axis (Family Shrine)**: Used for worshipping ancestors, with rich graphical content, prominent plots, and flexible composition, which is one of the representative features of Poku Hui New Year Paintings.
8.  **Matching Axis (Large Flowers)**: Used as decoration on both sides of the axis, generally auspicious flowers, with a stable composition of two panels (Figure 1-9).
9.  **Deity Images**: Used for New Year sacrifice, including God of Wealth (God of Wealth in the second hall, Civil God of Wealth, Military God of Wealth), Shenma (Jia Ma, Paper Horse), Zaoma (the riding Kitchen God part above the Kitchen God image).

These demands for New Year paintings and detailed posting methods closely integrated with Spring Festival customs jointly form the broad folk foundation upon which Poku Hui New Year Paintings survive and develop.
