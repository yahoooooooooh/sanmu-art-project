# 38-The Secret of Burning Willow Branches for Charcoal: The Source of Gaomi Puhui New Year Painting's Unique Material

The reason why Gaomi Puhui New Year Paintings can form their unique "pukhui" technique and rustic and elegant artistic style is inextricably linked to the unique materials they use. Among them, the charcoal sticks used for drafting and outlining have a particular method and raw material for their production.

According to literature, the basic material for making charcoal sticks used for drafting Puhui New Year Painting drafts is best selected from **willow branches that have grown for one year and are harvested during the winter leaf-falling season, which are relatively mature.**

These carefully selected willow branches cannot be used directly after being cut. They need to go through a special burning process:
1.  **Drying**: First, the cut willow branches are dried in the sun.
2.  **Burning in a barrel**: Then, the dried willow branches are placed in a long iron barrel and the lid is covered. The iron barrel containing the willow branches is placed on a fire for burning.
3.  **Controlling the heat**: The burning process requires precise control of the heat. When smoke is observed coming from the iron barrel, it indicates that the willow branches inside the barrel have basically been burned into charcoal sticks.
4.  **Cooling and drying**: After being burned into charcoal sticks, the entire iron barrel (including the charcoal sticks inside) is quickly placed in water to cool down. After it has completely cooled, the charcoal sticks are taken out and dried in the sun, and they are ready for use.

Through this unique folk craft process, ordinary willow branches are transformed into the special charcoal sticks needed for drawing Puhui New Year Paintings. The texture, hardness, and adhesion of these self-made charcoal sticks are compatible with the specific techniques of Puhui New Year Paintings and are difficult to fully replace with other ordinary charcoal pencils. It is this extreme attention to detail in materials and clever utilization that constitutes the material basis of the unique techniques of Gaomi Puhui New Year Paintings.
