# 64-Multiple Layers and Unique Charm of Decorative Language

The decorative language of Gaomi Puhui New Year Pictures is not singular or superficial, but possesses a multi-layered sense. From the initial sketching's interest to the final mounting, every step is permeated with a unique decorative charm, collectively forming its distinct artistic effect.

**Primitive Aesthetic Interest of Sketching**:
The "Puhui sketching" (扑灰起稿) itself carries a primitive aesthetic interest. Artists use willow charcoal instead of brushes, freely sketching on paper without restraint. This "starting gesture" itself represents an artistic conception and mindset, and the preliminary outlines and charcoal traces formed possess a simple and unadorned decorative meaning.

**Freehand and Concurrent Brushwork in Outlining and Coloring**:
Outlining and coloring based on the Puhui sketch, although not as unrestrainedly flowing and ink-drenched as pure literati freehand painting, still clearly exhibit a freehand quality. Early works like "Iron Crutch Li" (图5-1) allow one to appreciate this freehand style.
Later Puhui New Year Pictures underwent some changes in color and technique. The combined use of multiple painting techniques (such as a "鸳鸯毛笔" (Mandarin Duck Brush) with one thick and one thin end, allowing for varied line widths) resulted in works that have both the artistic conception of Chinese painting and the festive charm of New Year pictures. The use of lines is free-flowing and naturally dynamic, and this "form" decoration runs throughout the entire composition.

**Splendid Appearance Attached to Forms**:
Beyond the outline decoration of the forms themselves, the specific decorations attached to the forms constitute the splendid appearance of Puhui New Year Pictures. These decorations are multi-layered and colorful. For example, various floral images decorated with "咸菜磕花" (Pickled Vegetable Stamping) are often displayed on clothing and objects, adding a strong rustic flavor and festive atmosphere to the picture.

**The Finishing Touch of the "粉脸" (Powdered Face) Technique**:
The unique "粉脸" (powdered face) technique of Puhui New Year Pictures is a crucial step in its production process, akin to "画龙点睛" (dotting the eyes on a painted dragon). Artists mix special white powder with transparent glue and evenly apply it to the character's face. Then, they add a little peach-red blush to the cheeks and skillfully and meticulously outline the eyebrows and eyes, finally applying clear oil for protection. The face treated in this way (as shown in the partial powdered face of the mother and child picture in 图5-2) not only enhances the beauty of the picture but also appears full of elasticity and a good sense of flesh. The "粉脸" (powdered face) is generally used on the faces of women and babies, becoming a unique sight in Puhui New Year Picture figure paintings.

**Overall Aesthetic Independence and Artistic Value**:
Puhui New Year Pictures have achieved their own aesthetic independence through their unique techniques and multi-layered decorative rendering. They are not merely seasonal items purchased for festive occasions; after careful artistic mounting, they possess cultural and artistic value for collection, appreciation, and gifting to friends and relatives.

This multi-layered decorative expression, from internal conception to external presentation, enables Gaomi Puhui New Year Pictures to still showcase their unique decorative style and artistic charm in today's era of surging technology.
