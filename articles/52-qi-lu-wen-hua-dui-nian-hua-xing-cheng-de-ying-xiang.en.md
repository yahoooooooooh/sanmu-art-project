# 52-Double Nourishment from Qilu Culture: Exploring the Cultural Background of the Formation of Poku Hui New Year Paintings

As a folk art with distinct regional characteristics, Gao Mi Poku Hui New Year Paintings are deeply rooted in the fertile land of Qilu culture. In his research, Wen Xin conducted an in-depth analysis of how Qilu culture influenced the creation of Poku Hui New Year Paintings.

**Comprehensive Penetration of Qilu Culture**:
Gao Mi is located in eastern Shandong, within the core region influenced by Qilu culture. This cultural influence is all-encompassing, from the local people's way of thinking to their living customs, all permeated with the imprint of Qilu culture, and the development of folk art is naturally no exception.

**Fusion Characteristics of Qi Culture and Lu Culture**:
Qilu culture itself has rich connotations, gradually formed by the fusion of Qi culture and Lu culture:
*   **Qi Culture**: Absorbed the characteristics of Dongyi culture, focused more on utilitarian practicality, emphasizing innovation and creation.
*   **Lu Culture**: More followed Confucian tradition, respected rituals, emphasized order and tradition.
The fusion of these two cultural characteristics provided the cultural genes for Poku Hui New Year Paintings to maintain tradition while absorbing innovation.

**Confucian Core and "Ritual and Music Education"**:
Qilu culture takes Confucian thought as its core, particularly emphasizing "respecting human relations and honoring rituals". This thought has a deep social foundation in the Shandong region, shaping generations of Shandong people through "ritual and music education", and profoundly influencing local customs and the themes and expressions of folk art. For example, there are a large number of works in Poku Hui New Year Paintings that embody the theme of "people-oriented, filial piety first" (as shown in Figure 1-1 "Twenty-Four Filial Exemplars"), which is a direct reflection of Confucian ethical thought in art.

**Influence of Qing Dynasty Culture**:
Poku Hui New Year Paintings reached their peak development during the Daoguang period of the Qing Dynasty, so the culture of the Qing Dynasty had a profound influence on them. As a regime established by ethnic minorities, the Qing Dynasty actively absorbed the essence of Han culture while retaining some of its own cultural characteristics. The Confucian thought it promoted (such as the Three Cardinal Guides and Five Constant Virtues) was of great significance for consolidating its rule. Many existing Poku Hui New Year Paintings are Qing Dynasty versions, and from the figures' clothing, object shapes, to decorative features, the influence of the cultural art of that time can be seen. For example, the appearance of figures in both Ming and Qing costumes in "Family Shrine" and "Clan Portrait" (as shown in Figure 1-2) is a reflection of dynastic change in sacrificial culture.

**Intermingling of Surrounding New Year Painting Arts**:
In addition to the macro social and cultural background, Poku Hui New Year Paintings, as a style of New Year Painting, cannot exist in isolation. In its development process, it was also influenced by other folk art forms in surrounding areas, such as Tianjin Yangliuqing, Weixian Yangjiabu, and Pingdu New Year Paintings. By absorbing and learning from the essence of these sister arts, and then integrating its own painting characteristics, it finally formed the colorful Poku Hui New Year Paintings we see today.
