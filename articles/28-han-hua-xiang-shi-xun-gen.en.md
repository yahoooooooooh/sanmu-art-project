# 28-Ancient Echoes on Han Dynasty Stone Carvings: A Conjecture on the Artistic Origin of Puhui New Year Paintings

Although the clear origin of Gaomi Puhui New Year paintings is set in the early Ming Dynasty, the germination of its artistic genes might be traceable back to the more distant Han Dynasty. An important archaeological discovery provides us with a clue for this conjecture.

In 1973, in Zhuzhuang, Tianzhuang Township, Gaomi, Shandong, a symmetrical Han Dynasty stone carved door painting was unearthed. The upper approximately two-thirds of this stone door painting depicts a pair of majestic door gods, while the lower part of the door painting is accompanied by a pair of vivid fish.

These two sets of patterns have striking similarities with the themes of existing Gaomi Puhui New Year paintings. "Door gods" and fish symbolizing "surplus year after year" are both extremely typical and common subjects in Puhui New Year paintings.

More interestingly, from the perspective of production technique, Gaomi Puhui New Year painting has a characteristic: a meticulously drawn original draft can be duplicated into two symmetrical left and right images by the technique of "puhui" (dusting) from both the front and back sides. This symmetry coincides with the symmetrical layout of the door gods and fish on the unearthed Han Dynasty stone carved door painting.

Therefore, researchers Ge Hanqing and Ouyang Jubo believe that from this unearthed Han Dynasty stone carved door painting, we can "catch a glimpse of the ancient artistic symbols and artistic atmosphere of Puhui New Year paintings." Although this is not a direct chain of evidence, it suggests that the cultural soil and aesthetic genes upon which Puhui New Year paintings rely for their production may have begun to be nurtured and accumulated in the Han Dynasty.
