# 63-Symbolic Meaning and Cultural Changes of Decorative Patterns

The decorative patterns in Gaomi Puhui New Year Pictures are not merely for beautifying the picture, but also carry rich symbolic meanings and cultural connotations. These patterns exhibit diversity and certain evolutionary rules, influenced by the decorated objects (gods, figures, artifacts, etc.), as well as the times and regional culture.

**Auspicious Patterns in Deities and Sacred Figures Themes**:
In New Year Pictures depicting deities and sacred figures, which have religious worship significance, the decorative patterns primarily convey auspiciousness and festivity.
*   **God of Wealth (Wen)**: Robe sashes are often decorated with auspicious cloud patterns, bat patterns (representing blessing), dragon patterns (representing wealth and status), etc.; the treasure basin is often decorated with fire patterns.
*   **Boy Immortals**: Clothing is often decorated with patterns like the character "福" (blessing) and "寿" (longevity).
*   **武财神及其他神祇** (God of Wealth (Wu) and other deities): Decorative patterns largely follow similar principles of auspicious meaning.
*   **圣佛形象** (Sacred figure images): May feature symbols with strong religious and cultural connotations, such as "卍" (Buddha) and "宝相花" (Baoxiang flower, precious appearance flower).

**Simple Decoration in Mythological Stories and Opera Characters Themes**:
In New Year Pictures with strong narrative elements, such as mythological stories ("八仙过海" - Eight Immortals Crossing the Sea, "和合二仙" - He He Er Xian - Two Immortals of Harmony and Union) and opera characters themes, decorative patterns are relatively fewer. Even if present, they are mostly pure aesthetic embellishments like bats, auspicious cloud patterns, or "咸菜磕花" (Pickled Vegetable Stamping). This may be because these works focus more on the narration of the story and the portrayal of character personalities, where excessive decoration might overshadow the main subject.

**Solemn and Complex Decoration in "家堂" and "族影"**:
"家堂" (Jia Tang, family shrine picture) and "族影" (Zu Ying, clan portrait), which are central to New Year rituals, are the most elaborate in their decoration. Not only are there decorations on figures' clothing, but architectural decorations are also extremely important, often using traditional Chinese patterns to symbolize the family's dignity and honor. The areas around the ancestral tablets often feature auspicious symbols such as 连心纹 (lianxin wen - interconnected heart patterns), 盘长 (panzhang - endless knot), 寿字纹 (shouzi wen - longevity character patterns), etc., expressing remembrance and respect for ancestors, as well as good wishes for the future generations' happy lives.

**Freehand and Casual Decoration in Secular Life Themes**:
In New Year Pictures depicting secular life, especially opera story paintings, decorative patterns sometimes appear more freehand and casual. For example, in "周瑜打黄盖" (Zhou Yu Beats Huang Gai) (Figure 4-9), the figures are generalized, and the decorative patterns are even somewhat arbitrary, with "a few swish-swish strokes being both brushstrokes and clothing patterns," flexible, unrestrained, and unconventional. "燕青买线" (Yan Qing Buys Thread) (Figure 4-10) embodies the decorative beauty of lines. Besides "咸菜磕花" (Pickled Vegetable Stamping), there are also 竹叶纹 (zhuye wen - bamboo leaf patterns) and some line combinations that resemble patterns. This decorative style is relatively rare in Chinese New Year picture art.

**Pure Formal Decoration in Works with a Strong Urban Life Flavor**:
In some works with a strong urban life flavor, the decoration of clothing and other items mostly lacks specific symbolic meanings, and is more for formal aesthetics. The decoration in these works focuses more on the completeness of the plot and the dramatization of the content, and the decoration itself only needs to be visually appealing.

These decorative patterns' application reflects Puhui New Year Pictures' flexibility and adaptability in different themes and cultural contexts, and also embodies their cultural characteristics deeply rooted in folk beliefs and aesthetic customs.
