# 53-The Mark of Regional Economy: Subject Matter Selection and Pattern Evolution of Early Poku Hui New Year Paintings

The formation and development of Gao Mi Poku Hui New Year Paintings were also deeply influenced and constrained by the regional economic conditions during specific historical periods. Wen Xin's research reveals how economic factors left their mark on subject matter selection, pattern style, and even production techniques.

**Economic Recovery in Early Ming Dynasty and the Desire for Population Prosperity**:
In the late Yuan and early Ming dynasties, due to prolonged warfare, the economy of Gao Mi in eastern Shandong was severely damaged, presenting a scene of "vast land and sparse population, wilderness for thousands of miles." The rulers in the early Ming Dynasty advocated agriculture, and after a period of recuperation, the economy gradually recovered. In this context, people generally hoped for population prosperity, peace, and tranquility in life. Therefore, during this period, many New Year painting styles symbolizing multiple children and blessings, and family prosperity were created, such as **"Kylin Delivering a Child" and "Pomegranate Opening to a Hundred Sons"**. These themes perfectly matched the general psychological needs of the people at that time, and the price of New Year paintings was also within the economic affordability of ordinary people.

**Relative Stability and Subtle Changes in the "Kylin Delivering a Child" Pattern**:
Taking "Kylin Delivering a Child," a common theme, as an example (as shown in the Qing Dynasty version in Figure 1-3 and the 1940s version in Figure 1-4), the composition and dynamic posture of the main figures maintained a relatively "standardized style" with little change in different periods. The main differences were reflected in the changes in some decorative details, such as the adjustment of auspicious patterns, changes in the decoration of figures' hair buns, and differences in the objects held by the figures, each of which represented different auspicious meanings. The relative stability of the main pattern, on the one hand, might be to maintain the classic style easily accepted by the market. On the other hand, the author speculated that "this may also be restricted by economic conditions at that time and related to people being busy with their livelihoods," which lacked the motivation and conditions for large-scale pattern innovation, presenting a feeling of "following the old ways."

**Craftsmanship Selection under Economic Constraints**:
Legend has it that in the early days, a family named Wang in Gongpo Miao Village, northeast of Gao Mi, being poor, copied literati paintings and temple murals to sell at the market for a living. Ordinary people at that time could not afford real paintings to decorate their homes, so this relatively inexpensive hand-painted "quasi-New Year painting" form was able to survive and develop.
Economic constraints also directly influenced the choice of painting tools. **Using willow charcoal for painting was simple and easy to obtain, low cost, and had a certain copying effect**, suitable for small-scale production. This makeshift craftsmanship, through years of development and refinement, gradually formed a unique style of New Year painting art, specifically for folk festivals.

It can be seen that regional economic conditions not only influenced the subject matter content of Poku Hui New Year Paintings but also, to a certain extent, shaped the evolution path of its pattern style and the selection of production techniques.
