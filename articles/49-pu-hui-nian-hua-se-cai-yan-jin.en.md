# 49-From "Old Mo Hua" to "Red Goods": The Evolution of Color in Gaomi Puhui New Year Painting

The use of color in Gaomi Puhui New Year Painting has also undergone a process of development and evolution, from the early elegant style dominated by ink wash to the later vibrant and enthusiastic colorful style that borrowed from and absorbed the characteristics of other New Year paintings, together forming its rich and diverse color palette.

**Early Period: "Dark Old Mo Hua"**
In its early stages, Puhui New Year Painting was mainly composed of deity images and ink screen flower-and-bird paintings, and its use of color was relatively simple, dominated by ink wash, with colors not being strong. Local painters called them "dark old Mo Hua." These works had an elegant and simple style, with潇洒 smearing and drawing throughout, creating a natural charm. Representative works include over thirty kinds of story-themed ink screen paintings such as "Su Wu Herding Sheep," "Dongfang Shuo," and "Tieguai Li."

This "ink screen," also called "Old Mo Hua," "Black Goods," or "Ink Color Painting," was a black and white painting without bright colors, similar to today's ink wash Chinese painting. Its production and development were mainly influenced by the literati paintings and temple murals of that time. There was once a folk rhyme describing it: "Ink screen, ink screen, pure offerings on the desk. Wives dislike it, old men favor it. Goods sell to those who know their worth, each has its own future." This also reflects the acceptance of its simple style among different groups of people. In the "Shandong Gaomi County Folk Art Exhibition" held in Beijing in June 1984, exhibited Puhui New Year Painting works such as "Four Old Men Ink Screen" were hailed by experts as "world folk freehand paintings," which is a high affirmation of this ink wash style.

**Later Period: The Birth of "Red Goods" and the Innovation of Color**
By the Qing Dynasty, especially after the Qianlong period, the use of color in Puhui New Year Painting developed a completely new appearance. In addition to pursuing dynamic figures and bold and flowing lines, "fresh and attractive" became an important goal pursued by artists. At this time, in addition to ink color, colors such as ultramarine, rouge, indigo blue, vermilion (red pigment), and yellow began to be used in the paintings. However, at this stage, color mainly played a role of embellishment and brightening in the painting, not dominating.

**The Striking Contrast of "Red Goods"**
Unlike the simple elegance of traditional "Old Mo Hua," another type of Puhui New Year Painting called "Red Goods," which is colored New Year painting (also known as "Big Brush" and "Big Color Painting"), was developed by borrowing and absorbing the color usage of Tianjin Yangliuqing New Year Painting and Weifang Yangjiabu Woodblock New Year Painting.
The characteristics of "Red Goods" are:
*   **Actively leaning towards bright red and green**: Boldly using bright and saturated colors.
*   **Insisting on replacing ink with color**: Color becomes the main means of expression in the painting, and ink wash only plays a role of shading.
*   **Pursuing the vibrant and festive colors of the painting**: Giving a strong contrast and visual impact, satisfying the people's psychological need for festive joy and prosperity. Corresponding to "Red Goods," there is also a rhyme: "Red goods women smear with big brushes, selling well in the market. Hung on the walls of farmhouses, joyful and prosperous." This shows that the people also like this vibrant style of New Year painting.

For example, in the work "Playing the Vertical Flute," the colors of the figures' clothing reach up to five kinds, but the cuffs, collars, and skirt pleats are drawn with ink color, making the entire painting have appropriate lightness and darkness, and the figures are expressed more vividly.

**Color Integration in the Half-Printed, Half-Painted Period**
During the Daoguang period of the Qing Dynasty, influenced by Weifang Yangjiabu Woodblock New Year Painting, Puhui New Year Painting appeared in the form of half-printed and half-painted works. In this form, lines were first printed with woodblocks, and then colors were hand-painted. Its color usage also developed from the early single-color flat application to a combination of modulated color blending and "wild brush smearing." Some strip works even used ink wash as the main color tone, forming an artistic characteristic of "combining meticulousness and spontaneity." For example, "The Twenty-Four Stories of Filial Piety" New Year painting was first printed with ink lines and then colored. The clothing of the figures in the painting is drawn with light and dark ink, and in some places, there are even several layers of ink color, giving a flowing feeling.

This evolution and diversity of color make Gaomi Puhui New Year Painting able to meet the aesthetic needs of different periods and different groups of people, showcasing its strong artistic vitality.
