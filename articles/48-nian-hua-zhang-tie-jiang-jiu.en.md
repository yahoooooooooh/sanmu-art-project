# 48-The Etiquette of Posting New Year Paintings: Distinctions Between Inside and Outside, Young and Old

Gaomi Puhui New Year Painting is not just a form of art, but also an important component deeply integrated into the local people's Spring Festival customs and daily life. The various New Year paintings with different contents have very detailed rules regarding where they should be hung and posted, reflecting the traditional etiquette of "distinctions between inside and outside, different rooms, and different ages," so that different rooms can be refreshed for the New Year and carry specific meanings.

**Specific Spaces and Specific New Year Paintings**:
*   **"Kitchen God"**: Also known as "Dongchu Siming" (Lord of the Eastern Kitchen), it is a New Year painting specifically posted in the kitchen. The Kitchen God presides over human stove fires and food, and is closely related to people's lives. The Kitchen God in the painting often appears alongside his wife.
*   **God of Wealth**: Divided into "Civil God of Wealth" (said to be the incarnation of Prime Minister Bi Gan of the Shang Dynasty) and "Martial God of Wealth" (said to be the incarnation of Guan Gong). The common characteristic of both is "loyalty." There are also works that depict both Civil and Martial Gods of Wealth together, with the upper part being the Martial God of Wealth and the lower part being the Civil God of Wealth. The styling of the Civil God of Wealth is often an image wearing a first-rank court robe and a prime minister's hat; while the image of the Martial God of Wealth in Gaomi Puhui New Year Painting is often Guan Gong reading at a desk, which is different from the common image of Guan Gong wielding a large saber in other places. One can buy a God of Wealth New Year painting and use it for several years. After the New Year (usually after the fifteenth day of the first lunar month), the homeowner will carefully collect it and keep it for the next year.

**Choosing New Year Paintings for Rooms of Different Age Groups**:
*   **Rooms of the Elderly**: Generally hung with New Year paintings with themes such as "The Twenty-Four Stories of Filial piety," "Blessing and Longevity," "Increasing Longevity," and "Crane Longevity." This reflects the general psychology of people as they enter middle and old age, hoping for extended lifespan and expecting filial piety from their children. The styling of the Longevity Star, in addition to the conventional image of holding a staff in one hand and a longevity peach in the other, also includes scenes where the Longevity Star carries a child on his back and where two Longevity Stars appear simultaneously, which is relatively rare in other New Year paintings. "The Twenty-Four Stories of Filial Piety" tells touching legends about filial piety to the elderly throughout history in a pictorial and textual format (such as "Wang Xiang Lying on Ice," "Giving Up Official Post to Find Mother," "Selling Oneself to Bury Father," etc.), and is very popular among the elderly.
*   **Rooms of Young Women**: Generally hung with New Year paintings such as "Kicking Shuttlecock," "The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl," and "Celestial Maidens Scattering Flowers," which display the liveliness of young women and their yearning for beautiful love. In "Kicking Shuttlecock," some even depict the shuttlecock as a butterfly, adding more interest.
*   **Rooms of Wives**: Generally hung with New Year paintings depicting themes of family harmony and happiness, such as "Aunt and Sister-in-law Chatting," "One Hundred Sons Competing for Top Honors," "Second Mother Teaching Son," "Kirin Delivering Child," "Lotus Giving Birth to Noble Sons, Grace Bestowing Orchids and Grasses," "Leisurely Mood," and "Mother and Son." The styling of the beautiful women in these paintings is mostly based on wealthy young wives from the late Qing Dynasty and early Republic of China, with high-collared tops and "three-inch golden lotuses" being typical features of figure styling in this period.

These detailed rules for posting make Gaomi Puhui New Year Painting not just simple decorations, but also cultural carriers that regulate family atmosphere, transmit ethical concepts, and embody good wishes.
