# 08-Two Peaks Standing Together: "Lao Mo Hua" and "Hong Huo" in the Heyday of Gaomi New Year Pictures in the Late Qing Dynasty and Early Republic of China

Entering the period from the Guangxu era of the Qing Dynasty to the early Republic of China, the development of Gaomi New Year Pictures reached a glorious peak. During this period, the original Puhui New Year Pictures and the innovated half-printed, half-painted New Year Pictures permeated each other and developed together, presenting a prosperous scene of "a hundred flowers blooming." Particularly noteworthy was the formation of two major artistic factions during this period. They had distinct styles and unique characteristics, jointly constituting the "two peaks standing together" at the artistic summit of Gaomi New Year Pictures â€“ these were "Lao Mo Hua" (Old Smear Painting) and "Hong Huo" (Red Goods).

**"Lao Mo Hua": The Traditional Character of Primitive Simplicity and Elegance**

"Lao Mo Hua" primarily inherited and continued the tradition of early Puhui New Year Pictures in painting ink screens. Its artistic style exhibited the following prominent features:
*   **Primitive and elegant painting style**: Pursuing an aesthetic conception of returning to simplicity and not valuing ostentation.
*   **Plain and steady**: Tending towards calmness and introversion in color application, not pursuing strong visual impact.
*   **Free and unrestrained brushwork, as wild as splashing ink**: Although the colors were plain, the brushwork appeared free and vigorous, even with the unrestrained pleasure of splashed ink, making the picture "naturally interesting."

**"Hong Huo": The Pursuit of Bright and Festive Colors**

In stark contrast to the plainness of "Lao Mo Hua," "Hong Huo" displayed a passionate and unrestrained folk aesthetic taste. It boldly drew on "the color application techniques of Yangjiabu in Weixian and Yangliuqing New Year Pictures in Tianjin," and was unique in its color expression:
*   **Using color in place of ink**: Breaking through some limitations of traditional ink painting, further emphasizing the expressive power of color.
*   **Colors leaning towards bright red and green**: Boldly using bright, saturated colors, especially red and green series, to create a festive and lively atmosphere.
*   **Pursuing the effect of bright, festive colors and strong contrasts**: Enhancing the visual impact and appeal of the picture through strong color contrasts, satisfying the public's psychological need for festivity and auspiciousness during the New Year.

The classical elegance of "Lao Mo Hua" and the vibrancy of "Hong Huo" jointly enriched the artistic face of Gaomi New Year Pictures, also reflecting the coexistence and development of different aesthetic tastes in folk art.
