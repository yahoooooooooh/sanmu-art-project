# 76-Freehand Splashing and Meticulous Brushwork: The Fusion of Techniques in Puhui New Year Paintings

The unique artistic charm of Gaomi Puhui New Year Paintings lies in the clever fusion of two technical characteristics: "xieyi" (freehand) and "gongbi" (meticulous brushwork). This is vividly reflected in their widely circulated paintingè¯€ (formula/rhyme): "Brush, brush, brush, plant flowers in a row; large splashes and wild strokes, drawing outlines with a brush; carefully powder the face, skillfully draw eyebrows and eyes; if you want it to look good, engrave flowers like pickled vegetables."

**"Xieyi" and "Large Splashes and Wild Strokes"**:
"Large splashes and wild strokes, drawing outlines with a brush" accurately summarizes the "xieyi" characteristics of Puhui New Year Paintings in overall drawing. When painting, especially when dealing with large areas such as clothing patterns and backgrounds, artists often use techniques like "smearing" and "splashing," similar to the splashed ink and splashed color techniques in freehand Chinese painting, pursuing a free and unrestrained effect completed in one go. To improve efficiency, special tools such as mandarin duck brushes, flat brushes, and splashing brushes were also created. This "xieyi" characteristic is the soul of Puhui New Year Paintings and a key feature that distinguishes it from other types of New Year paintings. Whether it is the "old smeared paintings" (black goods) which are mainly ink-based, or the brightly colored "red goods," their painting cannot be separated from the word "smear."

**"Gongbi" and "Skillfully Draw Eyebrows and Eyes"**:
"Carefully powder the face, skillfully draw eyebrows and eyes" highlights the "gongbi" pursuit of Puhui New Year Paintings in detail depiction, especially in the treatment of human faces. Artists are extremely meticulous about the steps of opening the face, powdering the face, outlining the facial features, etc., emphasizing "carefulness" and "skillful drawing." The face is often first applied with white powder, and after drying, the facial features are meticulously outlined and the skin tone is applied, and finally, clear oil is applied to achieve a rosy and delicate skin texture. This meticulous depiction of the characters' expressions (the so-called "expressing the spirit lies in these eyes") gives Puhui New Year Paintings a vivid and lively appearance.

The freehand splashing of "large splashes and wild strokes" and the meticulous brushwork of "skillfully draw eyebrows and eyes" complement each other in Gaomi Puhui New Year Paintings, together forming its unique artistic style of combining "gongbi" and "xieyi."
