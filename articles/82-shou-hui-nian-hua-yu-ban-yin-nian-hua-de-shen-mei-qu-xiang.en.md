# 82-Hand-Painted and Block-Printed: The Divergent Aesthetic Orientations of Puhui New Year Pictures

Gaomi Puhui New Year Picture insists on "entirely hand-painted" as its main technique, which fundamentally distinguishes its aesthetic orientation from woodblock New Year Pictures (including semi-printed and semi-painted, and full-color block printing), thus creating unique artistic charm.

**The Uniqueness of "Painted Flavor"**:
Unlike the "block flavor," "knife flavor," and "print flavor" emphasized in woodblock New Year Pictures, the core aesthetic characteristic of Gaomi Puhui New Year Picture lies in its "painted flavor." This "painted flavor" is reflected in:
1.  **Flexibility of Composition**: Hand-painting allows for greater freedom in composition, often pursuing simplicity and etherealness, approaching the artistic conception of literati painting, which is different from the common full and formulaic compositions of woodblock New Year Pictures.
2.  **Vividness of Modeling**: Although there is a draft as a basis, each hand-painted New Year Picture is re-created by the artist. The expressions of the figures and the handling of lines have room for personal expression, thus presenting diverse forms and rich variations, rather than the monotonous replication of woodblock printing.
3.  **Richness of Color**: Hand-painting is not limited by the number of color blocks, allowing for extensive use of blended colors and gradients. The color layers are richer and more delicate, making it easier to create the artistic charm of ink wash painting and subtle visual effects. Woodblock New Year Pictures, on the other hand, mostly use primary colors, resulting in strong color contrast and vivid effects.

**Source of Artistic Style**:
The "freehand" style of Puhui New Year Pictures partially originates from the imitation of literati ink wash painting since the Yuan and Ming dynasties. Its techniques like "mo" (抹) and "shuan" (涮) have the same artistic effect as the "泼墨" (splashing ink) in traditional Chinese painting, pursuing the expression of brushwork interest and spiritual charm. Even semi-printed and semi-painted New Year Pictures (such as those from Yangliuqing), although colored by hand, have their contours and modeling fixed by the printing block, limiting the freedom of hand-painting.

**Differences in Aesthetic Implication**:
Woodblock New Year Pictures mostly use strong colors, full compositions, and formulaic modeling to create a festive and lively atmosphere for the New Year. Their aesthetic value is more reflected in their craftsmanship and decorative nature. Gaomi Puhui New Year Pictures, however, convey a more individualized and artistic aesthetic implication with their hand-painted agility, ink wash elegance, and subtle colors, sometimes even comparable to literati painting sketches.

It is this unique "painted flavor" brought by the insistence on hand-painting that makes Gaomi Puhui New Year Pictures stand out among the many folk New Year Pictures in China.
