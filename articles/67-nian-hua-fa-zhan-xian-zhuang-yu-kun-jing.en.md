# 67-The Game Between Inheritance and Market: The Current Development Status and Dilemmas Facing Gaomi Puhui New Year Pictures

As an important intangible cultural heritage, Gaomi Puhui New Year Pictures have undergone hundreds of years of development, and their inheritance to this day is not easy. However, in today's society, it also faces numerous development dilemmas and challenges.

**"陈陈相因" (Following the Old Ways) in Content and Lack of Innovation**:
Although Puhui New Year Pictures experienced a printing boom since the early 20th century, the innovation in its content and themes has lagged behind. Currently, the production of Gaomi Puhui New Year Pictures is largely "按照传统陈陈相因" (following the old ways according to tradition). The Puhui New Year Pictures sold in the market are mostly repetitive styles. For example, classic themes like "姑嫂闲话" (Aunt and Sister-in-Law Chatting) are available in almost every shop, but the level of craftsmanship and prices vary greatly. Aside from copying past masterpieces, few truly new masterpieces have emerged. Many artists' research on Puhui New Year Picture graphics also largely remains at the level of imitating tradition and has failed to deeply study the classics and recreate upon this foundation, leading to a lack of novelty in graphic design and a sense of "似曾相识" (déjà vu).

**Contradiction Between Production Efficiency and Commercial Value**:
*   **效率低下** (Low Efficiency): In today's mass production, the purely manual or semi-hand-painted production method of Puhui New Year Pictures (even if it developed to the half-printing, half-painting stage) is far less efficient than modern color printing. Low efficiency naturally leads to low economic returns, which puts pressure on artists' survival in a commercial society.
*   **市场萎缩** (Market Shrinkage): The development of modern cities and changes in living environments have led to a gradual reduction in the space and customs for hanging traditional New Year pictures. Modern home decoration styles are diverse, and traditional Puhui New Year Pictures are often replaced by other artworks such as oil paintings, traditional Chinese paintings, or abstract art. Many people believe that the latter better reflects "生活品质" (quality of life), leading to a relatively limited market demand for Puhui New Year Pictures, except for collections by cultural centers and museums or individuals with special preferences.

**Deep Crisis Facing Inheritance**:
1.  **后继乏人** (Lack of Successors): "师父收徒弟难" (Masters finding apprentices is difficult) has become a common phenomenon. After the older generation of artists retire, it is difficult to find suitable and willing excellent apprentices to study and inherit this skill. This is like a break in the ecological chain, leading to the gradual decline of Puhui New Year Pictures.
2.  **产量有余，精细不足** (Sufficient Quantity, Insufficient Quality): Although there are many workshops producing Puhui New Year Pictures, there are not many high-level works that truly represent its artistic value. Many works, in pursuit of commercial interests, neglect the refinement of artistry, and even when imitating tradition, it is difficult to achieve the exquisite delicacy of the past.
3.  **保护措施“治标不治本”** (Protection Measures "Treating the Symptoms, Not the Cause"): Although attention to Puhui New Year Pictures has increased in recent years, and some research institutions and scholars are making efforts to rescue and protect this art (such as promotional introductions, editing and publishing, collection and exhibition of original works), these measures still remain at a "surface level" to some extent and have not fundamentally solved the problems of inheritance and development. For example, issues such as the social status and livelihood security of artists, the balance between the artistic and commercial aspects of Puhui New Year Pictures, and the academic development and innovative transformation are all realistic challenges.

These dilemmas warn us that the protection and development of Puhui New Year Pictures require deeper, more systematic, and more forward-looking thinking and action.
