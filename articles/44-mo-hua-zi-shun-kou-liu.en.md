# 44-The Soul of "Mo Huazi": Interpreting the Technical Essence in Gaomi New Year Painting Rhymes

The style of Gaomi Puhui New Year Painting can be summarized in one word: "Mo" (smear). Local folk painters therefore colloquially call Puhui New Year Painting "Mo Huazi." A widely spread rhyme in the area vividly and figuratively conveys the core and essence of its drawing techniques:

**"Brush, brush, brush, a streak of planting flowers;**
**Big wash, wild smear, tracer drawing and pulling;**
**Careful powdering of the face, skillful drawing of eyebrows and eyes;**
**To make it look good, pickled vegetable stamping flowers."**

This rhyme is not only catchy but also contains several key steps and characteristic techniques of Puhui New Year Painting creation:

*   **"Brush, brush, brush, a streak of planting flowers"**: Vividly describes the sense of speed and fluency during drawing. "A streak of planting flowers" may refer to quickly brushing out decorative patterns or color blocks in a continuous manner on the background or clothing.

*   **"Big wash, wild smear, tracer drawing and pulling"**: This is a concise summary of the main brushwork of Puhui New Year Painting. "Big wash, wild smear" refers to using a specially made large brush for large-area, ink-splashing-like smearing and brushing, especially when dealing with clothing, hair, etc. With one stroke, the moisture and amount of color can naturally form layers of depth, taking straightness within curves, simplifying complex details, and creating a free and unrestrained, rough yet refined charm. "Tracer drawing and pulling" refers to using a fine brush (tracer) for meticulous outlining, such as the facial features and fingers of figures, forming a sharp contrast with "Big wash, wild smear," reflecting the style of "combining meticulousness and spontaneity."

*   **"Careful powdering of the face, skillful drawing of eyebrows and eyes"**: Points out the most subtle and meticulous part of Puhui New Year Painting technique â€“ the treatment of the figure's face. "Powdering the face" means first applying a layer of white powder as a base to the figure's face to form a white face shape (like theatrical makeup). Then, on this basis, the eyebrows, eyes, and facial features are meticulously outlined, followed by applying light colors and finally clear oil.

This treatment makes the figure's face particularly prominent, with clear features, and possessing a translucent, delicate, and elastic "flesh-like quality" rarely seen in other folk New Year paintings. For example, in works like "Two Beauties" and "Kicking Shuttlecock," the images of beautiful women, with their lotus-like powdered faces, tender and expressive eyes, slightly closed red lips, and faint blush on their cheeks, all benefit from this technique of "careful powdering of the face, skillful drawing of eyebrows and eyes," shaping vivid and lifelike female figures.

*   **"To make it look good, pickled vegetable stamping flowers"**: Reveals a highly localized and practical original craft. Artists locally sourced ingredients like radishes and carved them with geometric patterns or floral designs to make simple "stamps." Dipping these in color and "stamping" them onto the clothing that had been wildly smeared with a large brush created regular and lively decorative patterns. This "pickled vegetable stamping flowers" technique not only greatly improved production efficiency (it is said that masters could paint over 70 sheets a day) but also enhanced the visual effect, truly demonstrating ingenuity.

This rhyme is the crystallization of the wisdom of Gaomi New Year painting artists' long-term practical experience and a vivid footnote to understanding the unique artistic charm of Puhui New Year Painting.
