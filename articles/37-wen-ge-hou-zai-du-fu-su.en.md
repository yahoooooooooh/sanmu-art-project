# 37-Revival After the "Cultural Revolution": Gaomi New Year Paintings Regain Vitality

Gaomi Puhui New Year Paintings, in their development history of several hundred years, have not always been smooth sailing and have also encountered serious setbacks. Especially during the "Cultural Revolution" (1966-1976), a large number of traditional New Year painting works and precious old New Year painting plates (printing plates) were considered "Four Olds" and were burned and destroyed, causing this ancient folk art to face the danger of being lost at one point.

The turning point appeared after the convening of the Chinese Communist Party's "Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee" (December 1978). With the adjustment of national policies, the Party and the government began to re-emphasize the protection and excavation of folk art. At the same time, with the gradual improvement of people's material living standards, the demand for spiritual and cultural life also increased.

Against this backdrop, Gaomi Puhui New Year Paintings, which had gone through hardships, regained vitality.

During this period, the main production areas of Gaomi New Year Paintings were concentrated in traditional New Year painting villages such as Mianhuatun, Zhenjiatun, Dongchengzi, Lijiazhuang, and Beicun. Artists picked up their brushes again and resumed production. The main New Year painting themes included:
*   **Traditional sacrificial category**: Such as "Jiatang" (hanging scrolls), portraits of the God of Wealth, etc.
*   **Auspicious and festive category**: Such as "Da Hua" (large auspicious flower patterns), "Qilin Sending Son," "Lotus Giving Birth to People" (meaning many children and many blessings), etc.
*   **Figure stories and landscape category**: Such as ink screen Eight Immortals, landscape paintings, etc.

These newly produced Puhui New Year Paintings were mainly sold to areas within Shandong Province such as Laoshan and Changyi, as well as the traditional market in the three provinces of Northeast China, and also supplied local demand. With their distinct local flavor and auspicious meanings, they were widely well-received by the local people, marking the tenacious vitality of Gaomi Puhui New Year Paintings after experiencing a low point.
