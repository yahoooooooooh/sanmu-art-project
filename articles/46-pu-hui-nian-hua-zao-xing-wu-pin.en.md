# 46-Secrets of Styling (Part 2): Symbolic Props and Emotional Carriers in Puhui New Year Painting

In the figure styling of Gaomi Puhui New Year Painting, in addition to the unique facial treatment and body proportion, the items or props in the figures' hands also play an important role. The depiction of these items often does not pursue strict realism and proportion, but rather focuses on their symbolic meaning and their role in highlighting the figures' "fun" and living situations.

Literature points out that the items in the figures' hands in Puhui New Year Painting "are only symbolically represented, without focusing on proportional relationships, as if they are just props." The focus of the painters is more on showcasing the figures' "joy" and living situations through these props.

For example, in the works "Beauty with an Umbrella" and "Beauty with a Fan and an Umbrella," the umbrellas held by the figures are painted relatively small. Rather than practical rain gear or parasols, they are more like aids for posture and embellishments of identity. Similarly, the water buckets carried by the figure in "Beauty Carrying Water" are only symbolically outlined, without pursuing their real capacity or weight.

It is precisely through these seemingly "disproportionate" or "symbolic" small props that the figures are endowed with richer emotional connotations and a more authentic sense of life. Like props in a play, they help the viewer understand the figures' identity, the scene they are in, and the story that is unfolding. This treatment makes the painting full of strong local flavor and subtle secular emotions, bringing a sense of intimacy and vividness to people. It is no longer just painting objects, but borrowing objects to paint human feelings and the joy of life.
