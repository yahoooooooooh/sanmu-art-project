# 58-The Difficult Fate of Decline and Regeneration: The Modern Vicissitudes of Poku Hui New Year Paintings

The development of any art form is not smooth sailing, and Gao Mi Poku Hui New Year Paintings also experienced a tortuous process of decline and difficult regeneration after its glorious peak.

**Decline from Late Qing to Republic of China**:
In the Guangxu period of the late Qing Dynasty, Poku Hui New Year Paintings began to decline. This was closely related to the drastic social turmoil and economic depression in China at that time. A series of major historical events such as the Sino-Japanese War of 1895 in the twenty-first year of Guangxu (1895) and the Eight-Nation Alliance invasion in the twenty-sixth year of Guangxu (1900) caused huge damage to Chinese society. Especially after the Opium War, China gradually became a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society, and the urban and rural economies were severely damaged, with social unrest. Against this backdrop, as a folk art form rooted in the people, the development of Poku Hui New Year Paintings was bound to be seriously affected.

Until the early 20th century, although Poku Hui New Year Paintings might have maintained a certain scale in sales (such as the "Long Shun Yong" painting shop in the early Republic of China mentioned earlier), their content and themes appeared to be "following the old ways with no major progress, or even stagnating," and artistic innovation was weak.

The subsequent wars during the Republic of China and the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War further brought this ancient folk art to the verge of extinction.

**Revival and Setback after Liberation**:
After the founding of the People's Republic of China, with the gradual stabilization of social order and the initial organization of traditional culture by the state, Poku Hui New Year Paintings once began to revive.

However, during the "Cultural Revolution," Poku Hui New Year Paintings suffered a severe blow again, being regarded as a product of feudal superstition and suppressed and destroyed.

**Rebirth and Protection after Reform and Opening Up**:
The real turning point appeared after the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the CPC (1978). With the increasing importance the state attached to the protection of intangible cultural heritage, some art research institutions for Poku Hui New Year Paintings were successively established, which played an important role in its protection and inheritance.

On May 20, 2006, Gao Mi Poku Hui New Year Paintings were approved by the State Council to be included in the first batch of national intangible cultural heritage list, which marked its cultural value being highly recognized at the national level. At present, the rescue, excavation, and research of Poku Hui New Painting art are still ongoing, and it has also attracted the attention of more and more scholars and researchers.

Despite its difficult fate, Gao Mi Poku Hui New Year Paintings, with its tenacious vitality, have survived and continued through several ups and downs in the tide of the times.
