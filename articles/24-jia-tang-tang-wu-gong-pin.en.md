# 24-Detail Decryption of "Jia Tang" (Part 6): The "Three Offerings" and Symbols of Life in the Main Hall

On the altar table in the main hall of the "Jia Tang" New Year painting, in addition to the incense burner and candle holders, offerings dedicated to ancestors are meticulously depicted. The most central of these is the specific combination of sacrificial items known as the "Three Offerings," as well as the offering bowls symbolizing the continuation of life.

**The "Three Offerings" and Their Meaning**:
The "Three Offerings" usually refer to three main meat offerings, placed on the altar table, behind the incense burner. These three offerings are: fish, pig's head, and chicken.
The term "Three Offerings" represents two meanings:
1. **Literal Meaning - Freshness and Vitality**: The first interpretation believes that "Three Offerings" refers to the fact that these three items are fresh ingredients, representing freshness and vigorous vitality. Offering these to ancestors symbolizes the family bloodline continuing endlessly and flourishing.
2. **Homophonic Meaning - Auspicious Blessings**: The second interpretation is more ingenious, using the homophones of the names of the three offerings to express auspicious blessings:
    * "Fish" (鱼 yú) is interpreted as "surplus" (余 yú), meaning abundance year after year and a prosperous life.
    * "Pig" (猪 zhū) is interpreted as "master" (主 zhǔ), meaning the master's family is prosperous and the family business is stable.
    * "Chicken" (鸡 jī) is interpreted as "auspicious" (吉 jí), meaning auspiciousness and great fortune.
    Combining these three, the overall meaning expresses the beautiful wish of "the master's family is auspicious and has surplus."

**Offering Bowls and Green Plants**:
Behind the "Three Offerings," several "offering bowls" are also painted. The number of offering bowls depends on the size of the altar table depicted, usually four or six (all even numbers). A special detail is that green plants are painted inside these offering bowls. Green plants are symbols of life and vitality, and their depiction here further strengthens the beautiful expectation of the family life continuing and thriving.

These carefully selected and symbolically rich offerings are not only an embodiment of the descendants' filial piety towards their ancestors but also carry the deep prayers for the family's future prosperity.
