# 35-The Golden Age Climax in the Early Republic of China: The Brilliance of Wang Zhensheng and the "Longshun Yong" Painting Shop

In the early years of the Republic of China, the prosperous scene of Gaomi New Year Paintings reached its historical peak. During this period, numerous painting shops and artists together pushed Gaomi New Year Paintings to a new stage of prosperity. Among them, Wang Zhensheng from Jiangzhuang Dongchengzi and the "Longshun Yong" painting shop he founded are outstanding representatives of the brilliant achievements of Gaomi New Year Paintings during this period.

Wang Zhensheng, building upon the painting business inherited from his ancestors for generations, founded the largest painting shop in Gaomi at that time, "Longshun Yong," with his outstanding business acumen and artistic vision. How strong was its capacity? Historical records indicate that the "Longshun Yong" painting shop covered a full eighteen rooms, six of which were specifically used as painting studios. The number of its storefronts reached "at least 160," indicating its large scale of operation and rich variety of products.

To meet the huge market demand, "Longshun Yong" employed more than forty people for New Year painting creation. Its main New Year painting themes included "Zhuozi Tou" (a decorative painting), "Da Hua" (possibly referring to large-scale flower-themed works), and various "Da Ping" (large hanging scrolls or screen paintings).

At the same time, the New Year painting business in Dongfeng Village, Heå´–, Gaomi was also exceptionally prosperous. For example, the Zhang Shizhen brothers from the "Sansheng Yong" painting shop, in order to further expand their business, even traveled far to Yingkou (now Yingkou City, Liaoning Province) to open a branch. Due to good management, their business in Yingkou was even better than in Gaomi, employing a large number of people for production, and many fellow villagers from Dongfeng Village came to them for work. The literature also mentions an artist named Zhang Rongyao, who was skilled in both painting and carving, and his skills were exceptional. He was highly paid by "Sansheng Yong," and his salary treatment was "worth three," showing the preciousness of his skills.

During this period, the sales range of Gaomi New Year Paintings was extremely wide. In addition to supplying Jiaoxian, Jiaonan, Laoshan, Pingdu, Zhaoyuan, Haiyang, Rushan, and other places in the Shandong Peninsula, they were also sold in large quantities to the distant three provinces of Northeast China, showing their influence.
