# 11-Ritual and Music Education in Paintings (I): The Promotion of "Filial Piety First" in Puhui New Year Paintings

A significant difference between Qilu culture and other regional cultures lies in its distinct feature of "ritual and music education." This Confucian-advocated method of moral education, which uses ritual and music as a cultural norm of the upper class to educate and guide the populace, directly and profoundly influenced the thematic choices and content expression of Gaomi Puhui New Year paintings. Among these, "promoting filial piety" is an indispensable core theme in Puhui New Year paintings.

Qilu culture has always adhered to the values of humanism and prioritizing filial piety. Influenced by this cultural spirit, Gaomi New Year painting artists created a large number of works centered on the core idea of "abundance of blessings and longevity, with filial piety first."

For example, the work "Five Sons Offering Longevity" vividly expresses the themes of "abundance of blessings and longevity" and respecting the elderly and virtuous. In the painting, the God of Longevity, holding a dragon-headed cane, appears as if descending from the clouds, while five children holding auspicious objects eagerly come forward to offer him blessings. Auspicious symbols of longevity such as deer, ancient pines, and cranes are interspersed, creating a peaceful and festive atmosphere. The moral ideals advocated in "The Analects," such as "the old are comforted" and "the young are cherished," are concretely and vividly embodied in such New Year paintings, which also carry people's respect for the elderly and their wishes for health and long life.

In addition to works like "Five Sons Offering Longevity," another typical category of New Year paintings promoting the theme of filial piety is those based on the traditional Chinese "Twenty-Four Filial Exemplars." This type of New Year painting was once very popular in Gaomi folk culture. The educational significance they carried often greatly surpassed their simple ornamental value, becoming intuitive teaching materials for "filial piety" education for generations, deeply influencing local ethical concepts and family virtues.
