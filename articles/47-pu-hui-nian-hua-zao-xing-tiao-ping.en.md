# 47-Secrets of Styling (Part 3): Scroll Paintings with Scholar-Painting Characteristics and Auspicious Meanings in Puhui New Year Painting

In its development process, Gaomi Puhui New Year Painting also actively absorbed some characteristics of traditional Chinese scholar paintings, which is particularly evident in its scroll paintings in strip form. These strip paintings are usually in forms of two, four, or six panels, with rich content, combining the elegance of scholar paintings with the auspicious meanings of folk art.

**Expansion and Integration of Themes**:
The content of strip New Year paintings is extensive, commonly including:
*   **Depicting the Four Seasons**: Mostly using landscapes and flower-and-bird paintings as the main subjects. Folk artists cleverly transplanted the four seasons themes common in scholar paintings to Puhui New Year Painting and endowed them with richer auspicious meanings. For example, among flowers, peony symbolizes wealth and prosperity, lotus symbolizes the noble character of a gentleman, and the combination of lotus and carp symbolizes "abundance year after year."
*   **Narrating Complex Stories**: Using historical figures or literary allusions as creative themes, such as "High Mountains and Flowing Water," "Wang Xizhi Loves Geese," "Qinglian Drunk," "My Bamboo House," "Poetry and Painting Stories," "Hongwu's Tour," "The Fisherman's Gain," "Zhang Xu's Wild Calligraphy," "Li Bai's Drunken Drinking" and so on. These story paintings have cultural connotations and often carry the meaning of advising and educating people, such as "The Twenty-Four Stories of Filial Piety." According to textual research, this type of New Year painting that continuously tells stories can be regarded as the early prototype of modern Chinese comic strips, and they are suitable for hanging and appreciating throughout the year.

**Unique Compositional Forms**:
Some strip New Year paintings also have distinctive compositions, showing a clever combination of scholar painting and folk art:
*   **"Zhou Zi Loves Lotus," "Yuan Ming Loves Chrysanthemum" Four-Panel Screen**: The upper part usually has a circular or square pattern with a Tang poem printed inside; the middle part is a rectangular area painted with orchids in a style similar to Zheng Banqiao; the lower part is the main body of the figure story. The figure styling is natural, using white for the face, and the figures are very prominent.
*   **"Tang Poetry Flower and Bird Screen"**: The composition is even more special. The upper part depicts pine trees, the middle part of the lower section depicts flowers and birds, and Tang poems are written around the flowers and birds. Such a painting integrates poetry, painting, flowers and birds, and the sound of wind through pines, creating a profound artistic conception.
*   **"Landscape and Serene Strip Screen"**: The upper part is four seasons flower and bird, and the lower part is four seasons landscape, echoing each other, giving a very harmonious visual feeling.
*   **"Fruit Plate Matching Scrolls"**: The styling is particularly unique. Artists painted nine similar fruit plates in each scroll, but the fruits in the plates were different. "Nine" in traditional Chinese culture is the largest single digit and also the "extreme yang number" or "old yang," symbolizing multitude or wealth. This styling method profoundly expresses people's yearning for a beautiful and prosperous life.

These strip-form Puhui New Year paintings, which have absorbed characteristics of scholar paintings, possess both the festive and auspicious qualities of folk customs and the elegance and artistic conception of scholar paintings, serving as an important manifestation of the diversity of Gaomi New Year Painting art.
