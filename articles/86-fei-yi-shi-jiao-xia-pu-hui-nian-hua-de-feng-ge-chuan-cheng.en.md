# 86-Style Inheritance of Puhui New Year Pictures from the Perspective of Intangible Cultural Heritage: Challenges and Responsibilities in Safeguarding Cultural Genes

As a national intangible cultural heritage, the inheritance and protection of Gaomi Puhui New Year Picture face the challenges of the times. The core lies in how to accurately recognize and effectively inherit its unique artistic style, especially the "freehand" nature, which is its cultural gene.

**The Core of Inheritance: Adherence to Artistic Style**
The typical artistic style of Gaomi Puhui New Year Picture is its "freehand" nature, which is shaped by its historical origins, hand-painting techniques, material usage, and the folk culture it carries. Protecting Puhui New Year Picture means primarily protecting this unique artistic style, rather than merely preserving a few works or technique names. Inheritors should deeply understand and master the essence of traditional Puhui New Year Picture drawing, including "mo" and "shuan" freehand techniques and "细心粉脸、眉眼巧画" (careful face dusting, skillful eye drawing) meticulous techniques.

**Facing Challenges: Changes in Cultural Ecosystem and Market Orientation**
1.  **"Elegantization" of Aesthetic Taste**: With the change in consumer groups (from rural people to urban tourists and collectors), some artists begin to cater to the market, pursuing a more delicate and gorgeous "academic" or "literati painting" style, leading to the gradual loss of the rough, naive, and freehand folk essence of traditional Puhui New Year Picture.
2.  **Decline of Traditional Techniques**: The pursuit of speed and efficiency may lead to the simplification or abandonment of traditional complex processes, and the use of special tools and materials may also be replaced.
3.  **Authenticity of "Intangible Cultural Heritage"**: If Puhui New Year Picture loses its original cultural ecosystem and artistic characteristics, even if the name remains the same, its authenticity and cultural value as "intangible cultural heritage" will be greatly diminished. Innovation is necessary, but the creation of new New Year Pictures that keep pace with contemporary aesthetics should be distinguished from traditional Puhui New Year Picture in the sense of "intangible cultural heritage," avoiding putting the cart before the horse.

**Responsibilities and Paths of Inheritance**:
1.  **Government Guidance and Support**: Provide stable economic support and a good creative environment for inheritors, encouraging them to adhere to tradition.
2.  **Theoretical Research and Popularization of Education**: Strengthen in-depth research on the artistic value of Puhui New Year Picture and popularize the aesthetic value of traditional Puhui New Year Picture to the public, enhancing social awareness.
3.  **Adherence and Moderate Innovation**: While fully inheriting traditional techniques and styles, explore innovative paths that combine with modern aesthetics, but the distinction from the "intangible cultural heritage" itself should be clear, avoiding putting the cart before the horse.

Safeguarding the cultural gene of Gaomi Puhui New Year Picture is not only the protection of a folk art but also the cherishing and inheritance of the spiritual tradition and cultural diversity of the Chinese nation.
