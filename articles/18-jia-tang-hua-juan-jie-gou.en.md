# 18-The Macrostructure of "Family Shrine" Scrolls: Three-Part Space and the Beauty of Symmetry

Although Gaomi Puhui New Year paintings of "Family Shrine" (Jia Tang) are intricate in content and rich in detail, they have a relatively fixed structure and layout in their overall pictorial organization.

According to the research by Yang Aixia and Song Kuiyan, a complete "Family Shrine" New Year painting can be roughly and clearly divided into three main spatial parts:

1.  **Outside the Courtyard**: The outermost part of the painting, usually depicting scenes outside the residence.
2.  **Courtyard**: The transitional space connecting the area outside the courtyard to the core main hall.
3.  **Main Hall (Tangwu)**: The center and main body of the painting, the core place where ancestral tablets are placed and sacrificial rites are performed.

In representing these three spaces, "Family Shrine" paintings adopt a "two-dimensional spatial perspective" method with traditional Chinese characteristics. This method does not pursue the precise focal perspective of Western painting but instead presents a multi-layered sense of space through planar organization and symbolic arrangement of elements.

The overall layout of the painting exhibits distinct **symmetrical** characteristics. This symmetry is based on the painting's own orientation, clearly divided into left and right sides. This symmetry is not merely a pursuit of formal aesthetic beauty but also embodies the emphasis on balance, order, and etiquette in traditional Chinese culture. Although generally symmetrical, the purely hand-painted nature of Puhui New Year paintings means that the specific forms of objects on the left and right sides often have their own unique characteristics, showing variation within symmetry.
