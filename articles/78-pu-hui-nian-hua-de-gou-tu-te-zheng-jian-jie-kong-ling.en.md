# 78-Compositional Characteristics of Puhui New Year Paintings: Simple and Ethereal, with Symmetry

Gaomi Puhui New Year Paintings exhibit distinct characteristics in terms of picture composition, generally pursuing a simple and ethereal mood while cleverly utilizing symmetrical elements. This is both a manifestation of artistic pursuit and closely related to the characteristics of the hand-painting technique.

**Simple and Ethereal Layout**:
Apart from a few subjects such as family altar paintings and images of civil and military gods of wealth that pursue a full composition and complex content, most Puhui New Year Paintings, especially the ink-based works known as "old smeared paintings," are characterized by a simple and ethereal composition. Artists often emphasize the main figures, which occupy most of the picture area, while the background is often treated in a simplified and generalized manner, or even left blank. This treatment, on the one hand, is to improve production efficiency during the hand-painting process; on the other hand, it is also consistent with the aesthetic pursuit of traditional Chinese literati painting, creating an artistic conception of "space for a horse to gallop through" and an ethereal beauty, leaving room for the viewer's imagination. This "painting flavor" forms a sharp contrast with the "block flavor" of woodblock New Year paintings that pursue fullness and liveliness.

**Application of Symmetrical Elements**:
Symmetry is another significant characteristic of the composition of Puhui New Year Paintings.
1.  **Paired Works (Duihua)**: When copying with "Puhui," one draft can produce two symmetrical pictures, left and right. Artists cleverly utilize this characteristic to make slight variations to the symmetrical counterpart, creating a paired work that echoes the original draft, catering to the folk concept of "good things come in pairs."
2.  **Symmetry within a Single Work**: In a single work, particularly in subjects like family altars and gods of wealth, symmetrical composition is often used to enhance the stability and solemnity of the picture.

This simple and ethereal composition, while not losing its balance and symmetry, constitutes the unique visual aesthetic of Gaomi Puhui New Year Paintings.
