# 62-"Pickled Vegetable Stamping": A Unique Decorative Technique Born from Rural Wisdom

"Pickled Vegetable Stamping" (咸菜磕花) is a highly rustic and original decorative technique in Gaomi Puhui New Year Pictures. This seemingly "down-to-earth" craft embodies the infinite wisdom of folk artists and their ingenious use of everyday materials, adding unique visual effects and production convenience to Puhui New Year Pictures.

**Creative Inspiration from Life**:
Folk art best reflects the life experiences of ordinary people. As a rural art, the development of Puhui New Year Pictures is deeply influenced by the simple customs of Gaomi countryside. The creative inspiration for "Pickled Vegetable Stamping" is closely related to the food culture of northern China. Shandong is rich in radishes, and almost every household has the habit of pickling radish as a preserved vegetable. Radishes are common ingredients in local people's lives. It is not surprising that artists locally sourced and skillfully applied this ordinary pickled radish to their artistic creation. This artistic expression originating from life practice imbues the New Year pictures with a strong sense of life and vigorous vitality.

**Production Method and Characteristics**:
The specific method of "Pickled Vegetable Stamping" is: carve the pickled radish into "stamps" with simple geometric patterns or floral designs, then dip them in color and "stamp" or print them on specific parts of the New Year picture, such as on the characters' clothing.
This method has the following characteristics:
*   **Simple and Easy**: The tool is readily available (pickled radish), and the production is simple.
*   **Economical**: Material costs are extremely low.
*   **High Efficiency**: Significantly improves efficiency compared to single-brush fine drawing, facilitating mass production.

**Decorative Effects and Functions**:
Although it may sound simple or even playful, "Pickled Vegetable Stamping" can create ever-changing decorative patterns, adding color to the picture:
*   **Unity and Harmony**: Through repeated "stamping," rhythmic and dynamic decorative patterns can be formed in large areas like clothing, making the picture appear flexible and unified.
*   **Enriching the Picture**: Can effectively fill in space or emphasize local areas, increasing the layering and visual interest of the picture. As shown in Figure 4-3 "Kirin Bringing a Son," some stamped decorations make the picture appropriately dense and sparse, the content rich and natural, and more full of life.
*   **Enhancing Texture**: For example, in "Kicking Shuttlecock," the evenly stamped white circular flower dots on the girl's purple-red padded jacket make the clothing appear more transparent and light.
