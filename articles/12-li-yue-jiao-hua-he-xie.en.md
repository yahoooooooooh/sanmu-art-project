# 12-Ritual and Music Education in Paintings (II): Depiction of the Ideal of "Harmony and Benevolence" in Human Relations in Puhui New Year Paintings

Under the guidance of the "ritual and music education" thought of Qilu culture, Gaomi Puhui New Year paintings not only vigorously promoted filial piety but also enthusiastically expressed the ideal of "harmony and benevolence" in human relations. Qilu culture emphasizes interpersonal harmony, and its ethical function plays an important role in maintaining social stability. Confucius and his successors solidified Confucian doctrines into constant principles like the "Three Cardinal Guides and Six Disciplines," the core of which is the advocacy of harmony and benevolence. This ideal of human relations is also clearly reflected in the creation of Gaomi Puhui New Year paintings.

Puhui New Year painting artists delighted in depicting harmonious interpersonal relationships and warm family life with their brushes, thereby conveying positive values. "Five Sons Offering Longevity," mentioned earlier, is one example, while "Sisters-in-Law in Conversation" and "Mother and Child" (or "Motherly Love") more typically showcase this theme.

"Sisters-in-Law in Conversation" is one of the representative works of Gaomi Puhui New Year paintings. In the old rural society of China, the relationship between a woman and her husband's sister (gū sǎo) was often subtle. There was even a folk saying, "If the sisters-in-law are harmonious, the whole family is happy," which shows its importance in family harmony. This work, "Sisters-in-Law in Conversation," depicts a virtuous and gentle sister-in-law holding a parasol, with a quiet and delicate young sister-in-law snuggled beside her. The two walk side by side intimately, and the picture presents a gentle and elegant atmosphere. The artist boldly omitted the background, focusing only on the two sisters-in-law, making the entire picture concise yet full, inspiring a beautiful longing for the affection between sisters-in-law. Hanging such a New Year painting at home not only added a festive atmosphere but also had a subtle educational significance.

Another work, "Motherly Love" (also mentioned in literature as "Mother and Child"), vividly expresses profound maternal affection. In the painting, a dignified and gentle mother holds a folding fan, leaning against the back of a chair, while a lively and lovely young child is holding up his little hat, playfully acting coquettishly in his mother's arms. This work not only expresses blessings for the child's bright future but also creates a warm and harmonious family atmosphere, allowing people to feel the warmth and beauty of kinship.
