# 83-Vast World in the "Great Vulgarity": The Folk Essence and Contemporary Challenges of Puhui New Year Pictures

Gaomi Puhui New Year Picture originates from the countryside and serves the folk. Its artistic charm is rooted in the simple aesthetic concepts and rich New Year customs of ordinary people. The "entirely hand-painted" technique and the resulting "freehand" style are the fundamental aspects that distinguish it from other art forms.

**The Artistic Value of "Great Vulgarity"**:
Puhui New Year Picture is the art of working people in the agricultural era. The "vulgarity" it embodies is a "great vulgarity" that is close to life and reflects folk sentiments, different from the "elegance" of "highbrow" art pursued by literati painting. However, this "great vulgarity" contains strong vitality and unique aesthetic value. As folk art expert Zhang Daoyi said: "It has its own vast world, isn't it said that 'when it reaches the ultimate vulgarity, it becomes elegant'?" The "freehand" nature, the techniques of "mo" and "shuan," and the ethereal composition with blank space are the soul of Puhui New Year Picture.

**Challenges of the Contemporary Cultural Ecosystem**:
With the development of the times, the cultural ecosystem on which Puhui New Year Picture relies has undergone tremendous changes:
1.  **Changes in Consumer Groups**: From meeting the New Year customs needs of local farmers to serving tourists, collectors, and the gift market, purchasing motives and aesthetic standards have changed.
2.  **Shift in Creation Trends**: Some artists, to cater to the market or pursue economic interests, begin to imitate the refined and delicate styles of academic meticulous painting or modern literati painting. Works tend to be gorgeous and detailed, with a strong tendency towards "elegance," gradually deviating from the "freehand" essence and folk roots of traditional Puhui New Year Picture.
3.  **Inheritance Dilemma**: Artists who can adhere to traditional techniques are increasingly scarce. Some artists embark on the path of professional painters, and the prices of their works far exceed the affordability of ordinary people, which is not conducive to its living inheritance as intangible cultural heritage.

**Adherence and Innovation**:
Under new historical conditions, the core of inheriting and protecting Puhui New Year Picture lies in the correct understanding and adherence to its traditional artistic style. Innovation and development are necessary, and new New Year Pictures reflecting contemporary aesthetics can be created, but it must be clearly distinguished from the traditional Puhui New Year Picture in the sense of intangible cultural heritage. If it loses its most fundamental artistic quality and cultural gene, the significance of "intangible cultural heritage" protection will be greatly diminished. Puhui New Year Picture should explore points of integration with the times while maintaining its "great vulgarity" essence, allowing this ancient folk art to radiate new brilliance in the contemporary era.
