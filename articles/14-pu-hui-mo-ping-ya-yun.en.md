# 14-Ink Screens Generate Elegance: The Literati Painting Spirit in Puhui Ink Screens

Among the many categories of Gaomi Puhui New Year paintings, the one that most centrally embodies its "literati painting atmosphere" is a unique school known as "Puhui Ink Screens." These ink screen works, with their unique artistic style, clearly demonstrate the profound connection between Puhui New Year paintings and traditional Chinese literati painting.

The artistic style of Puhui Ink Screens mainly has the following characteristics:

*   **Elegant Style**: Pursuing a lofty and refined style, avoiding overly rich colors and secular expressions, leaning more towards the aesthetic tastes of literati.
*   **Simple and Dignified**: In terms of color application, ink wash is predominantly used, or light colors are applied, making the overall tone appear calm, restrained, and giving a sense of dignity and elegance.
*   **Free and Unrestrained Brushwork**: Although the colors are simple, the brushwork appears free and unrestrained, unconventional, pursuing a nimble and free-flowing quality.
*   **Naturally Interesting**: The overall picture strives for naturalness and abounds in interest, without deliberate carving, exhibiting a rustic beauty of natural unadornment.

This traditional painting method of Puhui New Year paintings is in line with the tradition of literati painting, which has always valued the "Xieyi" (freehand brushwork) spirit. "Xieyi" emphasizes expressing the author's subjective emotions and interests through concise brushwork and ink, not solely aiming for verisimilitude. Puhui Ink Screens, through their unique brush and ink language, convey an artistic pursuit and aesthetic ideal similar to that of literati painting.

It can be said that Puhui Ink Screens are a concentrated embodiment of Gaomi New Year painting artists learning from and absorbing the essence of literati painting, and also one of the important reasons why Puhui New Year paintings can surpass ordinary folk handicrafts and exhibit a higher artistic taste.
