# 33-Emergence of Masters in the Golden Age: Yang Weiqing, Pang Fengzhu, and "Anger and Difficulty for Cao and Hu"

The period from the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty to the early years of the Republic of China was the golden age in the history of Gaomi New Year Painting development. During this stage, in addition to forming the "Lao Mo Hua" and another major school that pursued vibrant colors, a considerable number of "rising stars" also emerged. These skilled folk artists, with their unique expertise and relentless efforts, made important contributions to the further prosperity and development of Gaomi New Year Paintings.

The literature specifically mentions several representative figures:

*   **Yang Weiqing**: A folk artist from Yujiatun, Gaomi South Countryside. He devoted his life to creating hanging scrolls with themes of insects, fish, flowers, and birds, and was particularly adept at painting "crickets," whose crickets under his brush were lifelike and full of wild charm.

*   **Pang Fengzhu**: A New Year painting artist from Shizikou, Gaomi. He was well-known in the countryside for painting "Da Ying" (a form of New Year painting, possibly referring to large, hanging New Year paintings, such as "Zhuzi" or "Jiatang").

*   **Cao Sen and Hu Xianglin**: The painting skills of these two artists were so superb that they even gave rise to a vivid folk saying in the local area: "Look at your appearance, enough to anger Cao Sen and make Hu Xianglin difficult." This slightly mocking remark, from the opposite perspective, confirms the exquisite skills of Cao Sen and Hu Xianglin in portrait painting or character depiction. The complexity and difficulty of painting the appearance of ordinary people were enough to make these two masters feel troubled. This undoubtedly is a great affirmation of their realistic ability and artistic expression.

It was the active participation and relentless creation of these folk artists, each with their unique expertise, that made Gaomi New Year Paintings exhibit a more diversified and refined appearance during the golden age, and also left precious artistic wealth for future generations.
