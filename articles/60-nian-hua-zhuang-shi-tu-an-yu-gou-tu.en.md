# 60-The Role of Decorative Patterns in the Composition and Layout of Poku Hui New Year Paintings

The decorative patterns in Gao Mi Poku Hui New Year Paintings are artistic treatments based on the aesthetic habits of ordinary people. They play an important role in the composition and layout of the picture, enriching the visual effect and carrying specific cultural connotations.

**Differences in Early and Modern Decorative Styles**:
The existing Qing Dynasty Poku Hui New Year Paintings have a relatively rough decorative style with a folk "earthiness". Modern Poku Hui New Year Painting works tend to be exquisite and delicate.

**Decorative Features of Two Major Schools**:
*   **"Lao Mo Hua"**: Its decorative style is mainly reflected in the use of ink wash, with light and stable brushwork and colors. The decorative patterns are also relatively stable, with light and fresh colors. Early works had almost no deliberate decorative graphics but shaped with lines, forming a certain formal beauty through brushwork and rubbing, sometimes only supplementing with simple cloud patterns in the blank spaces to form spatial contrast and avoid a closed picture. Figure 3-13 "Four Loves" embodies this characteristic. The inscriptions and signatures on the ink screen paintings also brought vitality to the picture in terms of form.
*   **"Red Goods" and Secular Life Themes**: The decorative patterns of these works are richer and more diverse. The clothing of figures and even the decoration of supporting objects sometimes do not have very clear practical meanings, but are more for visual "good looks". The form (size, density), lines (length), and color of the decorative patterns are often arranged according to the artist's preference and the overall needs of the picture.

**Common Positions and Elements of Decorative Patterns**:
The pattern decoration of Poku Hui New Year Paintings mostly appears on the clothing of figures and auspicious objects.
*   **Floral Elements**: Especially common is using flowers as the main decorative element.
*   **"Pickled Vegetable Stamp Flowers"**: Simple stamps in circular or other shapes carved from pickled radishes are very common in Poku Hui New Year Paintings. These flower patterns are harmonious in size, round and smooth. Although the patterns are slightly different (variations in the size and shape of the flower heart and petals), the basic form remains unchanged. Simple flower patterns on clothing may lose their specific symbolic meaning, but the overall decorative effect appears beautiful and elegant, with graceful postures. Figure 3-14 shows the flower pattern decoration on the girl's clothes in "Kicking Shuttlecock," which embodies the freehand brushwork effect of "Pickled Vegetable Stamp Flowers."

**Symbolic Meaning of Auspicious Patterns**:
An important function of floral decoration is to embody the meaning of auspiciousness and good fortune. Most of these auspicious patterns appear in a symmetrical form, reflecting the sense of balance of objects.
*   **Object Decoration**: As shown in the cornucopia in Figure 3-15 "Civil God of Wealth," its shape must be stable and balanced, and the decorative patterns on it (such as fire patterns) also need to appear serious and steady.
*   **Religious and Mythological Themes**: Auspicious cloud patterns, bat patterns, dragon patterns (symbolizing auspiciousness and wealth) are often used on the clothing of deities and holy figures; while religious symbols such as "Buddha" and "Baoxiang Flower" are also often used as decoration, symbolizing mysterious religious culture. Decorative patterns in mythological stories with strong plots (such as "Eight Immortals Crossing the Sea," "He He Two Immortals") are relatively few, and even if they exist, they are mostly purely formal decorations such as bats, auspicious cloud patterns, or "Pickled Vegetable Stamp Flowers."
*   **"Family Shrine" and "Clan Portrait"**: These sacrificial New Year paintings are the most elaborate in decoration. In addition to the decoration of figure clothing, architectural decoration also often uses traditional Chinese patterns to reflect dignity and honor. Auspicious symbols such as concentric patterns, endless knots, and longevity characters are often used around the spirit tablets.

**Influence of Regional Culture**:
The decoration of Poku Hui New Year Paintings has a strong Gao Mi regional flavor, closely related to the local living habits. The inspiration for the decorative method of "Pickled Vegetable Stamp Flowers" comes from the dietary culture of northern China â€“ Shandong is rich in radishes, and every household pickles them, making radishes a necessity of life. Using them in art creation gives the art a strong flavor of life and vitality.

The use of these decorative patterns not only beautifies the picture but, more importantly, they use the images and symbols that exist in the thinking and consciousness of the people of Gao Mi to show the life pursuits and aesthetic preferences of the villagers.
