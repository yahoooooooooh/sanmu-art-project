# 19-Decoding the Details of "Family Shrine" (I): Architectural Symbols and Lintel Messages Beyond the Courtyard

The "Outside the Courtyard" section of the "Family Shrine" (Jia Tang) New Year painting is the first sight that greets the viewer's eye. The depicted architectural and decorative details vividly recreate the grandeur of wealthy households during the Ming and Qing dynasties in China and are filled with auspicious symbolism.

**Gatehouse and Eave Ornaments**: In the center of the painting is usually a two-story gatehouse, a symbol of a prominent family. The eave jags (projecting parts at the edge of the roof) of the gatehouse are often decorated with "dragon heads" or figures popularly known as "Pekingese dogs" or "steel-fork beasts," which are decorative elements for warding off evil and symbolizing status.

**Side Gates and Couplets**: There is usually a side gate on each side of the gatehouse. Both the main gate and the side gates are meticulously painted with red couplets. The content of these couplets carries the family's aspirations and traditional virtues, for example: "Ancestral sacrifices for a thousand autumns endure, the main lineage for a hundred generations prospers" (praying for the family's long-lasting prosperity and numerous descendants), "Loyalty and honesty passed down through the family, poetry and books to continue the generations" (emphasizing loyalty, honesty, and scholarship as the foundation of the family).

**Door Jambs and Blessings**: In addition to the couplets on the door panels, "door jambs" (menpang) are also painted on the door frames. "Door jambs" are a type of smaller couplet pasted on the door frames, usually in the form of four-character idioms, with two characters on each side. Common content for door jambs includes "Source of water, root of tree" (metaphor for not forgetting ancestors and tracing origins), "Succeed in imperial examinations" (praying for descendants to achieve high ranks in imperial examinations and bring glory to the family). These couplets and door jambs together enhance the festive and lively atmosphere of the Spring Festival.

**Screen Wall and Auspiciousness**: Inside the main gate, a screen wall (also known as zhaobi) is usually set up. There are commonly two types of patterns on the screen wall: one is a directly painted large red "Fu" (blessings) character sticker, straightforwardly expressing the good wish of "blessings arrive at the master's home"; the other is more subtle and symbolic, depicting a rising "sun" and flowing "water." The rising sun symbolizes "the sun rising in the east," implying that the family is vibrant and flourishing; water, in conjunction with the large trees on both sides outside the gate, alludes to the meaning of "source of water, root of tree," symbolizing that the family has deep roots and unceasing vitality. Literature indicates that contemporary artists, to cater to market demand, more commonly paint screen walls with the rising sun motif.

These meticulously depicted architectural details and textual symbols full of auspicious meaning collectively constitute the rich connotation of the "Outside the Courtyard" section of the "Family Shrine" painting.
