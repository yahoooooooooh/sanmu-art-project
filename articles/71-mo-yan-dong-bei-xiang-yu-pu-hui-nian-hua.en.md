# 71-Mo Yan's "Northeast Township"'s Artistic Echo: A New Opportunity for Puhui New Year Paintings

The birthplace of Gaomi Puhui New Year Paintings happens to highly overlap with the "Northeast Township" depicted by Mo Yan, the 2012 Nobel Laureate in Literature and a writer from Gaomi. Mr. Mo Yan has confessed that the rich and colorful folk arts of Gaomi, such as clay sculpture, paper cutting, Puhui New Year paintings, and Maoqiang opera, are the fertile ground for his literary creation. These folk cultural elements, which he was exposed to since childhood, deeply influenced and even determined the artistic style of his works.

The Nobel Prize Committee's evaluation of Mo Yan's works also mentioned "the fusion of magical realism with folk tales, history, and reality," which undoubtedly affirmed the important position of folk culture in his creation.

With the widespread global attention on Mr. Mo Yan and his "Northeast Township" literary concept, it has undoubtedly brought unprecedented new opportunities for the promotion, popularization, and development of Gaomi folk arts represented by Puhui New Year Paintings. This kind of cultural celebrity effect helps to enhance the visibility of Puhui New Year Paintings, attracting more people to pay attention to this ancient folk art, thereby injecting new vitality into its inheritance and development.
