# 34-The Rise of Woodblock New Year Paintings and the Expansion of Themes: From "Huazidian" to Thousands of Households

In the late Qing Dynasty, Gaomi New Year Paintings, building upon Puhui New Year Paintings and Half-Print Half-Paint, further developed into full-color multi-block woodblock New Year Paintings. The main driving force behind this transformation came from the "Huazidian" (painting shops) pursuit of economic efficiency and continuous improvement of New Year painting techniques.

Famous Huazidian such as "Tongshun Tang," "Wan Ju," and "Qi Wanshun" in Beicun played an important role during this period. The characteristic of woodblock New Year Paintings is their "strong and concise lines." Through the multi-block color printing, a richer color effect and faster production speed could be achieved.

The themes of woodblock New Year Paintings also became closer to the daily lives and New Year customs of ordinary people, mainly including:
*   **Zhuo Wei (Table Skirts)**: Decorations used on the front of offering tables or eight-immortal tables.
*   **Zao Ma (Kitchen God)**: Used for worshipping the Kitchen God.
*   **Chuang Ding, Chuang Pang (Window Tops, Window Sides)**: New Year Paintings used to decorate around windows.
*   **Men Shen (Door Gods)**: Posted on the main door to ward off evil and bring good fortune.
*   **Zengfu Caishen "Huang Caishen" (God of Wealth for Increased Blessing)**: To pray for prosperity in wealth.

In order to better operate the New Year painting business, the artists put a lot of thought into it, which greatly promoted the prosperity of woodblock New Year Paintings. For example, Qi Jizhong, a descendant of the "Qi Wanshun" painting shop, in order to expand the New Year painting market, personally went to the "Zhan Zhuang" (a kind of warehouse or market) in Fangzi Street, Jiaoxian County, to sell New Year paintings, successfully breaking the geographical sales boundaries.

Driven by him, New Year painting artists from "Shunde Yong," "Ruisheng He," "Ruisheng Xiang," and other painting shops also followed suit, going to Jiaoxian, Laoshan Shazikou, Rizhao, and even Northeast China to promote their New Year painting products.

It was under the impetus of this active market expansion and technical innovation that during this period, various forms of colorful woodblock New Year Paintings were truly able to "enter thousands of households," becoming indispensable decorations and cultural symbols during the New Year festival for ordinary people.
