# 75-Research on the "Puhui" Technique: Inheriting Ancient Copying Wisdom

Gaomi Puhui New Year Paintings are named after their unique "Puhui" drafting technique, a traditional copying technology used to improve production efficiency that has been passed down to this day. It has a historical connection with the "Fenben" technique in the history of Chinese art.

**Origin of "Fenben"**:
"Fenben" (粉本) is a traditional method of copying paintings in ancient China. Yuan Dynasty's Xia Wenyan's "Tuhui Baojian" (图绘宝鉴) records: "Ancient people called painting drafts Fenben." There were mainly two methods: one was the needle-puncture powder dusting method, which involved densely pricking small holes along the ink lines of the draft and dusting powder through the holes onto the surface to form a dotted or line draft; the other was a method similar to carbon copying, where powder was applied to the back of the draft and then traced along the ink lines on the front.

**Gaomi's "Puhui" Technique**:
Gaomi Puhui New Year Paintings' "Puhui" technique is similar to "Fenben" but more direct:
1.  **Making the Gray Draft**: Charcoal sticks burned from willow branches are used to sketch the preliminary draft on paper, called the "gray draft."
2.  **Dusting and Copying**: This "gray draft" is placed over a new sheet of painting paper and dusted (or the new paper is placed over the gray draft and dusted), causing the charcoal powder to transfer onto the new paper, forming a mirrored outline of the original draft.
3.  **Repeated Use**: One gray draft can be used to dust multiple sheets. When the charcoal marks fade, the lines on the gray draft can be redrawn thickly and dusted again.

Although this "Puhui" technique is relatively primitive and mainly suitable for drafts with simpler content, it allows for rapid copying of drafts, saving time for subsequent hand-coloring. It is this clever application and adherence to traditional copying wisdom that constitutes a major characteristic of the production technique of Gaomi Puhui New Year Paintings and has had a certain impact on the formation of their symmetrical composition.
