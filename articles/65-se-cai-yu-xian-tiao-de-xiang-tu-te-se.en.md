# 65-Rural Characteristics of Color and Line: Visual Impact and Emotional Expression in Puhui New Year Pictures

The visual graphics of Gaomi Puhui New Year Pictures, with their distinct rural characteristics in color usage and line treatment, serve as an important component of their artistic charm, conveying visual impact and emotional expression.

**Evolution of Color and Emotional Implication**:
Color is the most direct reflection of a person's aesthetic psychology in aesthetic perception. The use of color in Puhui New Year Pictures is not static:
*   **Early "黑乎乎的老抹画子" (Dark Old Smudged Paintings)**: Pursued ink wash effects, related to literati painting characteristics, positioned between New Year pictures and literati painting. The colors were simple, basically single-toned, with an elegant style, but lacking sufficient festive atmosphere for the New Year.
*   **Appearance of "红货" (Red Goods) and Richness of Color**: To meet the demand for festive atmosphere during the New Year, artists drew upon the essence of color production from Yangliuqing New Year Pictures and incorporated it into the characteristics of Puhui New Year Pictures, creating the vibrantly colored "红货" (Red Goods). The commonly used colors are nothing more than red, green, yellow, purple, etc., which, through skillful application, are mutually integrated and permeated. This planar color composition is extremely aesthetically pleasing in form, and the picture layout is harmonious and well-proportioned without being rigid.
*   **Use of Dominant and Auxiliary Colors**: Each Puhui New Year Picture has a dominant color depending on the theme, while other colors serve as auxiliary. For example, "花鸟四季" (Four Seasons with Flowers and Birds) (图5-5) uses a rich and heavy combination of colors, with yellow, green, red, and purple harmoniously unified, having both auspicious meaning and natural interest. "花鸟四季屏" (Four Seasons Screen with Flowers and Birds) (图5-4) uses pink as the dominant color, complemented by other colors, with reasonable proportions and exquisite composition.

**Coexistence of Bold and Delicate Lines**:
Line is the direct external form of plastic arts, capable of shaping images and expressing the creator's aesthetic intention and emotions.
*   **Freehand Style Lines**: The lines in Puhui New Year Pictures are generally bold and smooth, pursuing a freehand style. This freehand quality conforms to the aesthetic taste of local customs and also provides a possibility for ordinary people to possess "painting art."
*   **Free and Lively Early Lines**: Before the appearance of half-printing and half-painting, the lines in Puhui New Year Pictures were a direct manifestation of the artist's artistic creation, full of emotion, without the constraints of formulaic patterns, contrasting with the cold printed lines of woodblock New Year pictures. Although they might seem a bit rough, their changes are natural, with boldness in broad strokes and meticulousness in delicate strokes.
*   **Varied Line Expression Depending on Theme**: The lines in Puhui New Year Pictures have proper balance of solid and void, varying according to figures and scenery, possessing characteristics of traditional Chinese painting. Lines for figures aim for fullness and roundness. For example, in "五福临门" (Five Blessings Arriving) (图5-7), to highlight details, the lines are fine, and the picture presents a planar decorative effect, but the tension in the lines reflects its artistic characteristics.

This unique color system and line language ensure that even if the theme and process are the same, the final artistic conception presented in each Puhui New Year Picture may differ, which is precisely the unique aspect of its inheritance as a handicraft.
