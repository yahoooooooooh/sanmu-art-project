# 13-The Elegance Between Brush and Ink: The Deeply Hidden Literati Painting Atmosphere in Gaomi Puhui New Year Paintings

Although Gaomi Puhui New Year paintings are rooted in the countryside and serve folk festivals, their artistic style's formation and development have been deeply influenced and enlightened by traditional Chinese literati painting. This "literati painting atmosphere" is not a simple superficial imitation but permeates multiple levels, including thematic selection, compositional management, brushwork and ink charm, inscriptions and colophons, and even the identity composition of early artists, collectively elevating the artistic style and cultural connotation of Puhui New Year paintings.

**I. Thematic Expansion: From Folk Prayers to Literati's Refined Tastes**

Early Puhui New Year painting themes mainly revolved around deity images, auspicious patterns, and opera stories to meet the practical needs of the populace for praying for blessings, good fortune, and warding off evil spirits. However, with the infiltration of literati aesthetic tastes, some themes reflecting literati's refined tastes gradually appeared in Puhui New Year paintings, such as the "Four Gentlemen" (plum, orchid, bamboo, and chrysanthemum), "Fisherman, Woodcutter, Farmer, and Scholar" representing reclusive sentiments, as well as historical allusions and portraits of sages. The introduction of these themes undoubtedly added more cultural connotations to the simple folk New Year paintings.

**II. Compositional Management: Learning from Management, Pursuing Artistic Conception**

Traditional woodblock New Year paintings often pursue a full and lively picture and sharp color contrasts. However, some Puhui New Year paintings, especially some early works or "ink screen" type works, show a shadow of literati painting's "compositional management" in their composition. They pay more attention to the interplay of void and substance, appropriate density, and pursue a poetic and picturesque artistic conception that evokes imagination, rather than merely satisfying the simple display of objects.

**III. Brushwork and Ink Charm: Emphasizing "Xieyi" (Freehand Brushwork), Especially in "Ink Screens"**

The core of literati painting lies in "Xieyi," emphasizing the expression of the author's subjective emotions and interests with concise brushwork and ink, not solely aiming for verisimilitude. Gaomi Puhui New Year paintings, especially the early ink wash style works known as "old抹画" (old wipe paintings), share a considerable affinity with the Xieyi spirit of literati painting in their nimble brushwork and ink variations.

**Among them, what can most centrally embody the "literati painting spirit" of Puhui New Year paintings is a unique school known as "Puhui Ink Screens."** These works usually possess the following artistic characteristics:
*   **Elegant Style**: Deliberately pursuing a lofty and refined style, avoiding overly rich colors and purely secular expressions, aligning more closely with the aesthetic tastes of traditional literati.
*   **Simple and Dignified**: In terms of color application, ink wash is predominantly used, or only very light colors are applied as an auxiliary, making the overall tone appear calm, restrained, and giving a sense of dignity and elegance.
*   **Free and Unrestrained Brushwork**: Although the colors are simple, the brushwork often appears free and unrestrained, unconventional, pursuing a nimble and灑脫 (free and easy) quality of the brush following the mind, completed in one breath.
*   **Naturally Interesting**: The overall picture strives for naturalness and abounds in interest, without excessive deliberate carving, exhibiting a rustic beauty of "a lotus emerging from clear water, naturally unadorned."
This traditional painting method of "Puhui Ink Screens" is a concentrated embodiment of Gaomi New Year painting artists learning from and absorbing the essence of literati painting's "Xieyi."

**IV. Inscriptions and Colophons: Poetry, Calligraphy, Painting, and Seal, Complementing Each Other**

Some fine Puhui New Year painting works also imitate the habit of literati painting by inscribing poems and colophons in appropriate positions on the picture, signing the author's name, and affixing imitation carved seals. This combination of poetry, calligraphy, painting, and seal undoubtedly enhances the artistic expressiveness and cultural taste of New Year paintings, making them not just a presentation of images but a comprehensive artistic expression.

**V. Artists' Identities: Participation of Folk Intellectuals**

According to research, among the early creators and inheritors of Gaomi Puhui New Year paintings, there were many folk intellectuals with a certain cultural cultivation or disillusioned scholars who retired to the countryside due to failures in the imperial examinations. They integrated their knowledge, aesthetics, and understanding of literati painting into the creation of New Year paintings, playing an important role in the formation of the early style and the elevation of the quality of Puhui New Year paintings.

In summary, Gaomi Puhui New Year paintings, in their development process, did not exist in isolation within a purely folk craft system but actively or passively absorbed many elements of literati painting. It is this unique fusion that allows Puhui New Year paintings to exhibit distinctive artistic charm and a higher cultural taste among many folk New Year painting categories.
