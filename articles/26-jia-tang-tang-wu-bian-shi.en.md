# 26-Detail Decryption of "Jia Tang" (Part 8): The Solemn Enclosure and Upper Sayings of the Main Hall

In the "main hall" section of the "Jia Tang" New Year painting, in addition to the core sacrificial area, the decorative borders on the left and right sides and the eaves and匾额 (plaque) at the very top also collectively create a solemn and dignified sacrificial atmosphere and convey profound cultural meanings.

**Four Styles of Main Hall Side Enclosures**:
There are four common forms for the enclosure and decoration of the main hall sides:
1. **Simple Style**: Directly painted black pillars, without any additional decoration, appearing simple and solemn.
2. **Hanging Curtain Peony Style**: Pillars (painted black) and pink hanging curtains are depicted. Above the hanging curtains, impressionistically styled peony flowers are usually painted. Peonies symbolize wealth and honor, expressing the yearning for the family's wealth and prosperity.
3. **Hanging Curtain Couplet Style**: Building upon the peony hanging curtains and pillars, couplets mourning the ancestors' virtues and merits and wishing for flourishing descendants are also written on the pillars, such as: "Ancestors' virtues and merits will last for thousands of years, descendants will inherit and continue for ten thousand springs" or "The golden incense burner's fire is never extinguished for a thousand autumns, the jade cup's light shines brightly for ten thousand years" etc.
4. **Golden Dragon Coiling around Jade Pillar Style**: This style is more common in modern "Jia Tang" paintings. With pink hanging curtains as a background, the main decoration is the magnificent "Golden Dragon Coiling around Jade Pillar" - on wine-red pillars, surging cloud patterns and majestic golden dragons are painted, the style is extremely elaborate, showcasing the family's nobility and grandeur.

**Eaves and Plaque Above the Main Hall**:
The very top of the main hall usually appears in the form of eaves, echoing the tall gatehouse eaves in the "outside the courtyard" section of the painting, forming an overall architectural sense. The left and right sides of the eaves are often covered with cloud patterns, and the tall green pine trees that soared into the clouds in the outer courtyard section are still faintly visible here, enhancing the sense of spatial extension and the overall integrity of the painting.

Below the eaves, in the center of the main hall, a plaque is hung. The text written on the plaque serves to highlight the theme and admonish future generations. There are two common types of plaque content:
1. **"慎终追远" (Shèn Zhōng Zhuī Yuǎn)**: Meaning to handle the funerals of elders cautiously and solemnly, and to devoutly worship and remember distant ancestors. This is an important concept in Confucianism emphasizing filial piety and family inheritance.
2. **"永言孝思" (Yǒng Yán Xiào Sī)**: Meaning to never forget to be filial to elders, and to always have feelings of gratitude and remembrance.

The authors of the literature specifically point out that some contemporary painters write phrases like "忠义祠" (Hall of Loyalty and Righteousness) on the plaques in Jia Tang paintings, which is unreasonable. This is because the core meaning of "Jia Tang" paintings lies in expressing the descendants' remembrance of ancestors and blessings for family members. While terms like "忠" (loyalty) and "义" (righteousness) are traditional virtues, using them on a "Jia Tang" plaque centered around family sacrifice does not fully align with its original meaning.

These side decorations and upper elements of the main hall collectively complete the solemn demarcation of the sacrificial space and constantly remind future generations of the family's traditions and virtues.
