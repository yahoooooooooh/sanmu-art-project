# 10-The Profound Heritage of Qilu Culture: The Cultural Source of the Unique Charm of Puhui New Year Pictures

The reason Gaomi Puhui New Year Pictures hold an irreplaceable position among China's many folk New Year pictures lies not only in their unique production techniques but, more profoundly, in the rich Qilu cultural heritage they embody.

Gaomi, Shandong, located in eastern Shandong, is an important region of Qilu culture. The long-standing Qilu culture in this land has not only shaped the thinking patterns and lifestyles of the local people but has also, like spring rain, subtly permeated and promoted the development of folk art. Gaomi Puhui New Year Pictures are precisely an artistic gem nurtured in this cultural soil.

The characteristic of "respecting humanities" in Qilu culture is vividly reflected in Puhui New Year Pictures. There is a widely circulated saying that the prototype of Puhui New Year Pictures is related to some impoverished scholars. They might have unintentionally brought the cultural aesthetics of the upper class to the common laborers. These cultural elements, combined with the people's own aesthetic preferences and their creative improvements in production techniques, eventually formed the Gaomi Puhui New Year Pictures we see today, characterized by Puhui drafting, half-printing and half-painting, etc.

In recent years, with the increasing emphasis and in-depth exploration of intangible cultural heritage by the state, the value of many folk arts, including Puhui New Year Pictures, has been re-highlighted. Gaomi City has also been named "Hometown of Chinese Folk Art" by the Ministry of Culture, which is undoubtedly an affirmation of its profound cultural accumulation. It can be said that it is the fertile land of Qilu culture that has provided a continuous source of nourishment for the emergence, development, and inheritance of Puhui New Year Pictures.
