# 73-The Historical Context of Puhui New Year Paintings: From the Early Ming Dynasty to the Republic of China

The origin of Gaomi Puhui New Year Paintings can be traced back to the early Ming Dynasty, boasting a long history of over six hundred years. Its development and evolution have roughly gone through the following important stages:

*   **Origin and Embryonic Stage (Early Ming to Chenghua Period of Ming)**: Started in the northeast township of Gaomi (Jiangzhuang, Xiazhuang, Dalan area), created by local poor literati imitating literati paintings and temple murals, combined with traditional pattern book techniques. The Wang family scholars from Gongpomiao Village are rumored to be the initiators. Early themes were mainly images of deities and ink screen flower and bird paintings. By the Chenghua period of the Ming Dynasty, it already possessed a mature production process and preliminary artistic style.
*   **Preliminary Development (Qianlong to Xianfeng Periods of Qing)**: During the Qianlong period, the Wang family of Gongpomiao began to accept apprentices (such as the four Zhang brothers), and New Year painting workshops appeared. In the late Qianlong period, the workshops of Hu Yuxian from Lijiazhuang, Zhao Dalun from Zhaojiaquan, and Du Wan from Dujia Guanzhuang promoted the spread of Puhui New Year Paintings, and the sales area expanded to Jiaodong, northern Jiangsu, and the Northeast. A pattern was formed where "there is Yangjiabu in Weixian in the north, and Gaomi Puhui in the south."
*   **Technological Innovation (Jiaqing and Daoguang Periods of Qing)**: Artist Hu Zhongkuan (also said to be Hu Dianbang) brought carved boards from Yangliuqing, Tianjin, combining the line board function of Yangliuqing woodblock New Year paintings with the hand-painting techniques of Puhui New Year paintings, initiating the precedent of Gaomi's "half-printed and half-painted" New Year paintings and improving production efficiency.
*   **Peak Period (Daoguang Period of Qing to Early Republic of China)**: On the basis of Puhui and half-printed and half-painted, some painting shops introduced the woodblock overprinting technology of Yangjiabu, producing pure woodblock New Year paintings. Gaomi New Year paintings presented a prosperous situation where three artistic styles coexisted: Puhui, half-printed and half-painted, and full-color overprinted woodblock. It reached its development peak from the Guangxu period to the early Republic of China.
*   **Decline (After the 1920s-1930s)**: Affected by Western printing technology (such as calendar New Year paintings) and war, the traditional New Year painting market shrank.
*   **Tortuous Revival (After the Founding of New China to the Present)**: After the founding of New China, there was organized collective production, which once revived. It suffered serious damage during the Cultural Revolution. Since the reform and opening up, especially since being listed as a national intangible cultural heritage, with the joint efforts of the government and the private sector, significant progress has been made in the rescue,整理, protection, and inheritance of Puhui New Year Paintings, and they have regained vitality.
