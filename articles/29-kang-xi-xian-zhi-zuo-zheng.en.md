# 29-《Gaomi County Annals》 as Testimony: Puhui New Year Paintings Became Common in the Kangxi Period of the Qing Dynasty

Gaomi Puhui New Year paintings originated in the early Ming Dynasty and have a history of over five hundred years to date. To trace their widespread acceptance and use among the populace throughout history, the 《Gaomi County Annals》 from the Kangxi period of the Qing Dynasty provides strong corroboration.

In the section "Seasonal Customs of the People" in the Kangxi carved edition of the 《Gaomi County Annals》, there is the following record: "In the month of the final winter... on New Year's Eve, sweep and clean the main hall, prepare offerings, replace door gods and peach talismans, write Spring Festival couplets, and paste 'tianzixie'..."

This passage clearly depicts the scene of New Year's Eve customs in the Gaomi area during the Kangxi period of the Qing Dynasty: every household cleans their house in the twelfth lunar month, prepares sacrificial food, replaces new door gods and peach talismans, and pastes Spring Festival couplets and various "tianzixie" (which can be understood as various small New Year paintings or auspicious patterns).

Among these, the custom of "replacing door gods" is closely related to the prevalence of door god themes in Gaomi Puhui New Year paintings. This is sufficient evidence that by the Kangxi period of the Qing Dynasty, Puhui New Year paintings represented by door gods had become deeply integrated into the daily lives of the local people, becoming an indispensable part of saying goodbye to the old and welcoming the new, and praying for blessings and auspiciousness at the end of the year and the beginning of the new year. They were no longer merely artworks but also important cultural symbols carrying folk beliefs and a sense of ritual for the festival.
