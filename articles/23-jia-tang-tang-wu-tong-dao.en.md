# 23-Detail Decryption of "Jia Tang" (Part 5): The Sacred Passage, Kneeling Cushions, and Altar Table in the Main Hall

The core part of the "Jia Tang" New Year painting is the "main hall," which is a sacred place for placing ancestor tablets, holding family sacrifices, and significant rituals. Every element within the main hall is meticulously arranged and full of symbolic meaning.

**Yong Lu: The Path to Ancestors**
In the center of the main hall is a "Yong Lu," which is the path leading to the altar table for sacrificing to ancestors. This Yong Lu is usually depicted in a "chessboard pattern," filled with alternating light yellow and greenish-gray colors, symbolizing ancient floor bricks and appearing simple yet solemn.

**Puduan: The Place for Pious Kneeling**
In the exact center of the Yong Lu, a "Puduan" (kneeling cushion) is painted, which is a mat used for kneeling during worship. The Puduan is generally oval-shaped, and there are three common styles:
1. **Lotus Shape**: The center has a lotus pattern, the colors used are orange-yellow or light pink, and the style is more impressionistic. The periphery of the Puduan may be covered with fine dots to represent the texture of a carpet, or a circle of swastika patterns (卍, a Buddhist auspicious symbol, signifying auspiciousness and myriad virtues) may be painted.
2. **Shou Character Shape**: The center directly writes a traditional Chinese character "Shou" (寿, meaning longevity), with no other excessive decoration, and the style is simple. Literature mentions that this style is rarely used in current "Jia Tang" paintings.
3. **Fu Shou Shape**: The center is a "Shou" character, surrounded by five bats ("bat" 蝠 fú is a homophone for "blessing" 福 fú, signifying "five blessings"). The layout of the bats is usually one at the top, two at the bottom, and one on each side. The style is mostly flat flying, with wings seemingly wrapped around each other. The overall style is impressionistic, expressing the auspicious meaning of full blessings and longevity.

**Altar Table and Sacrificial Vessels**: Behind the Puduan, at the end of the Yong Lu, is the altar table used for sacrificing to ancestors. In the center of the altar table is placed an "incense burner," used for burning incense, which is an indispensable vessel in sacrifices. On both sides of the incense burner, "candle holders" are symmetrically placed, used for holding candles to illuminate the sacrificial space, also symbolizing light and inheritance.

These elements together form the visual guidance and ritual space for entering the sacrificial area of the main hall.
