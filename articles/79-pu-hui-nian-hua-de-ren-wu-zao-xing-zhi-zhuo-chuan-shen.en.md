# 79-Character Modeling in Puhui New Year Paintings: Naive Yet Expressive, Uniquely Crafted

Gaomi Puhui New Year Paintings have formed a unique style of "naive yet expressive" character modeling, which has absorbed artistic nutrients from various sources and also reflects the ingenuity of folk artists serving the needs of New Year customs.

**Origin and Characteristics of Modeling**:
The character modeling in Puhui New Year Paintings integrates elements from New Year paintings from various places, the charm of Ming and Qing literati paintings, and the characteristics of temple murals. Especially in the modeling of court ladies, they mostly absorb the characteristics of late Qing dynasty clothing, pursuing elegance and subtlety, and being graceful and moving. Their general characteristics include:
*   **Proportion**: Mostly adopts a body length proportion close to that of children, with "five heads tall," appearing naive and lovely regardless of age, which conforms to the festive atmosphere of the New Year. The artistic formula says: "A standing person is five heads tall, sitting is half as short."
*   **Movement and Expression**: Emphasizes the perspective and expression of the face, especially the facial features. The artistic formula: "If you want to be fierce, squint your eyes. If you want to be happy, raise your eyebrows. If you want to be beautiful, curved eyebrows, slender eyes, a cherry small mouth, just a little bit." The hand-painting technique makes the expressions of the characters under each artist's brush different, full of vitality.
*   **Programmatic Features**: Does not deliberately pursue realism, facial features are delicate and straight, often with a longer upper body and shorter lower body proportion, the small feet of court ladies are particularly exaggerated, and the shape of the hands often has shadows of Buddhist and Daoist murals.

**Examples of Typical Character Modeling**:
*   **Fat Babies**: Full-bodied, round-headed and round-faced, lively and lovely, such as "Peaches Offering Longevity for a Thousand Years."
*   **Girls and Young Wives**: Mostly fair-skinned with powdered faces, willow eyebrows and phoenix eyes, charming and moving, such as "Aunt and Sister-in-law Chatting."
*   **Civil and Military Gods of Wealth**: The main and secondary figures are distinct, highlighting the main god through proportional size, often accompanied by auspicious patterns such as auspicious clouds and treasure basins. Such as "Civil God of Wealth" (Bigan paired with Qin Qiong and Jing De), "Military God of Wealth" (Guan Yu paired with Guan Ping and Zhou Cang).
*   **Scroll Painting Characters**: Imitating literati paintings, depicting historical figures or literary archetypes, such as "Four Loves Diagram" and "Twenty-Four Filial Exemplars," emphasizing freehand and simplified brushwork, naive yet expressive.

The character modeling in Gaomi Puhui New Year Paintings does not stick to anatomical structure, but aims at "capturing the essence" and "expressing the spirit," cleverly combining artistic aesthetics with utilitarian pursuit of good fortune, reflecting the wisdom of character creation in traditional Eastern aesthetics.
