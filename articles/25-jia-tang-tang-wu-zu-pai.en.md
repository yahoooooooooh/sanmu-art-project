# 25-Detail Decryption of "Jia Tang" (Part 7): The Core of the Main Hall - Ancestor Tablets and Appearance

The deepest part of the "Jia Tang" New Year painting's main hall modeling, and the core focal point of the entire painting, is the tablet or portrait symbolizing the ancestors of the lineage. This is the object of worship and remembrance for descendants, and its depiction also follows certain rules.

**Two Styles of Ancestor Tablets**:
Literature indicates that there are two common forms of representation for this part:

1. **"Qing Gong" - Only Tablets are Painted**:
    * **Main Tablet**: The main tablet in the center is depicted with the most detail and prominence. Its outer frame is usually blue, presenting an arched shape; the center is a red square area. The overall volume is relatively large, and characters like "Ancestors of Three Generations" or similar phrases are written on it, indicating that this is the core tablet for the recent direct ancestors.
    * **Subordinate Tablets**: On both the left and right sides of the main tablet, several subordinate tablets with relatively simple styles are painted. These subordinate tablets are usually only sketched in outline, without much color applied, and their volume is also smaller. The number is generally two or four (still even numbers).

2. **"Ancestor Portrait" - Combination of Tablet and Portrait**:
    * **Central Tablet**: Similar to "Qing Gong," there is also a meticulously depicted tablet in the center (blue arched outer frame, red square center).
    * **Ancestor Portraits**: The difference is that the left and right sides of the tablet are no longer simplified subordinate tablets, but instead, an elderly person is painted on each side, usually a male on the left and a female on the right, representing the ancestors of the family.
    * **Clothing Characteristics**: An important detail is that due to the history of migration from Shanxi to Shandong during the Hongwu period of the Ming Dynasty, the ancestors people commemorate often trace back to that period. Therefore, in the "Ancestor Portrait" form, the clothing of the ancestors in the painting is usually depicted as **Ming Dynasty clothing**, to reflect the historical origin and remembrance of ancestors.

**Tablet Grids on Both Sides of the Yong Lu**:
On both sides of the central Yong Lu in the main hall, fine lines are usually drawn to form vertical grids. Each grid represents a tablet used for writing the names of deceased family members. The number of grids depends on the size of the painting. In the arrangement of names, certain lineage rules are followed: "One row represents one generation, from top to bottom." Furthermore, the left side of the Yong Lu is for filling in the names of direct relatives, while the right side is for filling in the names of collateral relatives, reflecting a clear family lineage and relationship distance.

These meticulous depictions of ancestor tablets and portraits are a direct reflection of the core function of "Jia Tang" paintings as ancestor worship, and a vivid portrayal of the Chinese nation's emphasis on bloodline inheritance and filial piety culture.
