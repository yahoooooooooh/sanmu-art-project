# 66-Diversity of New Year Picture Tones and a Deeper Interpretation of Aesthetic Changes

The overall tone of Gaomi Puhui New Year Pictures has exhibited diverse characteristics throughout its development process, transitioning from the early monochrome ink wash style to the later rich and heavy colors. This reflects the aesthetic pursuits of different periods, influences from external art, and the evolution of the New Year picture's own function.

**Monochrome Tone of Early "老抹画" (Old Smudged Paintings)**:
Early works of Puhui New Year Pictures were mostly derived from literati paintings and temple murals, with a strong freehand style. This is fully reflected in the traditional characteristics of "老抹画" (Old Smudged Paintings). Their colors are relatively simple, basically positioned on a "monochrome" baseline. Works in this style, such as the early form of "家堂" (Jia Tang) (图5-8 left), have elegant, even slightly melancholic colors, which are somewhat insufficient compared to the festive atmosphere required for the New Year. This reflects the transitional stage of Puhui New Year Pictures developing from pure "painting" to functional "New Year pictures."

**"红货" (Red Goods) and the Bright Tones Emphasizing Contrast**:
To adapt to the festive atmosphere of the New Year and the aesthetic needs of the public, Puhui New Year Pictures absorbed the color characteristics of external New Year pictures (such as Yangliuqing New Year Pictures) and developed the "红货" (Red Goods) genre. Its tonal characteristics changed to:
*   **Strong Contrast**: Bold use of contrasting colors, such as 大红大绿 (bright red and deep green), creating a strong visual impact.
*   **High-key and Lively**: The overall tone tends to be bright and vibrant, which is more in line with the festive nature of New Year pictures.
*   **Rich Colors**: No longer limited to ink wash, various colors such as red, yellow, green, and purple are widely used.
This shift towards bright tones is the inevitable result of the market-oriented and folkloric development of Puhui New Year Pictures.

**Harmonious Tones and Hand-painted Characteristics**:
Even in New Year pictures that pursue color effects like the "红货" (Red Goods), and those used for worship such as "家堂" (Jia Tang) and "族影" (Zu Ying) (as shown in 图5-8 right, a modern painted "家堂" (Jia Tang)), their colors basically belong to "调和色调" (harmonious tones). Although contrasting colors are used boldly, their area and proportion are appropriate, and the expression of a light and tranquil home atmosphere is achieved more through the harmonious combination of 邻近色 (linjin se - analogous colors). This is related to the artistic characteristic of Puhui New Year Pictures where colors are hand-晕染 (yunran - blurred or smudged) after sketching with charcoal, making the color transitions relatively harmonious and natural.

**Tonal Expression of "孝文化" (Filial Piety Culture) Themes**:
A large number of works in Puhui New Year Pictures depicting "孝文化" (filial piety culture), such as "二十四孝图" (The Twenty-Four Examples of Filial Piety) (图5-10), also reflect the balance, harmony, stability, and unity pursued by traditional Confucian thought. These hand-painted New Year pictures exhibit relatively distinct personalized cultural transmission. Compared to the Mianzhu New Year Picture "二十四孝图" (The Twenty-Four Examples of Filial Piety) (图5-9) with its simple composition and bright, high-key colors, the Puhui New Year Picture "二十四孝图" (The Twenty-Four Examples of Filial Piety) is often in the form of 四条屏 (four panels), with closely connected stories, elegant tones, and relatively detailed depiction of figures, flowers, trees, houses, etc.

This evolution from monochrome to color, from elegant to intense, and then to the coexistence of multiple tones, is the result of continuous adjustment and innovation in Puhui New Year Pictures during different historical periods, facing different aesthetic needs and functional positioning.
