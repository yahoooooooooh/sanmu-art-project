# 61-"Concurrent Brushwork and Sketching": The Unique Painting Language and Style of Puhui New Year Pictures

"Concurrent Brushwork and Sketching" (兼工带写) is an important expression technique in Chinese painting, referring to the combination of fine brushwork (gongbi) and freehand brushwork (xieyi). Gaomi Puhui New Year Pictures skillfully integrate this technique into their creation, forming a unique painting style that features both delicate depiction and unrestrained boldness. This is vividly reflected in its "characteristic folk rhyme" - "Brush, brush, brush, plant flowers in a row. Large brush boldly涂抹, outline drawn with a thin brush. Carefully powder the face, skillfully paint eyebrows and eyes. To look good, stamp flowers with pickled vegetables."

**Embodiment of the Freehand Spirit**:
One of the origins of Puhui New Year Pictures is literati freehand painting. The "意" (intent/spirit) realm of "大笔狂涂" (large brush boldly涂抹) is a direct reflection of this freehand spirit, avoiding the formulaic and rigid nature that may appear in New Year picture production. For example, the work "Embroidery Shoes Story" (Figure 4-1), although it may seem a bit rough today, its large brush strokes and unrestrained lines carry a special artistic charm and naive spontaneity, reflecting the freehand style of early Puhui New Year Pictures.

**Fusion of Fine Brushwork and Freehand Brushwork**:
Following "大笔狂涂" (large brush boldly涂抹), "描子勾拉" (outline drawn with a thin brush) embodies the delicate and exquisite side of painting. This organic combination of unrestrainedness and delicacy has created the unique painting style of Puhui New Year Pictures.

**Comparison with Mianzhu New Year Pictures**:
Although both are hand-painted New Year pictures, and Mianzhu New Year Pictures also have a process similar to "tracing and hand-painting" (hand-painted after woodblock carving lines), there are significant differences in artistic style between the two. Mianzhu New Year Pictures follow their unique painting process of "one black, two white, three gold, five colors and six colors dress up," with natural color transitions and a pursuit of a realistic painting effect. The colors are also more vibrant and the contrasts are strong (as shown in Figure 4-2 "Three Monkeys Scalding a Pig"). In contrast, the "Concurrent Brushwork and Sketching" of Puhui New Year Pictures emphasizes more the interest of brush and ink and the contrast and harmony between fine and freehand brushwork. The coloring is relatively light or has its unique color system.

**The Subtlety of the "Powdered Face" Technique**:
"细心粉脸，眉眼巧画" (Carefully powder the face, skillfully paint eyebrows and eyes) is where the "gong" (fine brushwork) is best embodied in the "Concurrent Brushwork and Sketching" of Puhui New Year Pictures. In figure paintings, one or several pure white powdered faces are particularly prominent. The artist first applies a pure white powder base to the face, then skillfully outlines the facial features, followed by coloring and applying clear oil, making the character's face appear elastic and giving a sense of reality. This is a significant feature that distinguishes Puhui New Year Pictures from other New Year pictures.

This "Concurrent Brushwork and Sketching" painting style allows Gaomi Puhui New Year Pictures to have both the simplicity and spontaneity of folk art, while also retaining the brush and ink interest and delicate emotions of traditional painting, forming its unique artistic charm.
