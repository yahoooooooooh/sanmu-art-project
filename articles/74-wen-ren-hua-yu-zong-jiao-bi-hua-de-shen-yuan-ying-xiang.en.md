# 74-Literati Painting and Religious Murals: The Two Major Sources of Puhui New Year Painting Art Style

The artistic style of Gaomi Puhui New Year Paintings is not generated from scratch; its formation is deeply influenced by traditional Chinese literati painting and local religious murals.

**Influence of Literati Painting**:
During the Ming and Qing dynasties, literati painting became the mainstream aesthetic form of Chinese art. The Gaomi area had a strong literary atmosphere, and many literati painters emerged (such as Liu Tongxun and his son Liu Yong), whose works circulated in the countryside, subtly influencing the local aesthetic taste. At the very beginning of its origin, Puhui New Year Paintings had the background of local poor literati imitating literati paintings. Therefore, whether in form (such as focusing on ink wash, mounted as vertical scrolls, combining poetry, calligraphy, painting, and seals) or content (such as expressing literati tastes and Confucian thought), Puhui New Year Paintings clearly bear the imprint of emulating literati painting. This pursuit of "elegance" makes Puhui New Year Paintings unique among folk arts.

**Influence of Religious Murals**:
In the agricultural era, temples and monasteries were scattered throughout the countryside and were important places for the spiritual beliefs of the people. Temple murals, as important carriers for spreading religious ideas and educating the public, directly influenced folk art in terms of painting style and subject matter. Many Puhui New Year painting artists also worked part-time painting temple murals, and they naturally incorporated the modeling elements, line characteristics, and color usage techniques of temple murals into their New Year painting creations. This influence is particularly evident in New Year paintings with themes of deities and Buddhist/Daoist figures (such as "Thousand-Hand Guanyin" and "God of Wealth"), giving Puhui New Year Paintings a solemn and simple atmosphere.

The "elegance" of literati painting and the "vulgarity" of temple murals intertwine in Gaomi Puhui New Year Paintings, jointly shaping its unique artistic style.
