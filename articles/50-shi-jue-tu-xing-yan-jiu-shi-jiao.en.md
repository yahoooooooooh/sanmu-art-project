# 50-New Perspective: Interpreting the Inheritance and Innovation of Puhui New Year Painting from the Perspective of Visual Graphic Design

As a valuable cultural heritage, the research and inheritance of Gaomi Puhui New Year Painting often focus on the perspective of folklore. However, in her Master's thesis, Wen Xin takes a unique approach by deeply analyzing Puhui New Year Painting from the professional perspective of **visual graphic design**, providing us with new ideas for understanding and developing this ancient art.

The study believes that it is insufficient to limit Puhui New Year Painting solely to the category of traditional folk art for protection. By researching its historical background, cultural connotation, and production process, and then focusing on analyzing the **graphic layout rules, graphic composition characteristics, and decorative language features** of Puhui New Year Painting at different stages of its development from a visual perspective, its artistic characteristics can be more comprehensively grasped.

The purpose of this research is not only theoretical analysis but also practical application:
1.  **Exploring Design Features and Differences**: Through comparison, identify the unique aspects of Puhui New Year Painting's graphic design that distinguish it from other New Year paintings and its inherent design elements.
2.  **Exploring Contemporary Design Transformation**: Hoping to refine these unique graphic features and design elements into a representative stylistic pattern and explore their application possibilities in contemporary design practice (such as brand design, cultural and creative products, etc.), rather than just staying at simple replication of traditional folklore.

Examining Puhui New Year Painting from the perspective of visual graphic design helps us to understand more deeply "what makes it look good," discover its potential "shortcomings and areas for improvement," thereby enhancing public aesthetic levels, and providing a solid theoretical basis and innovative path for this ancient art to flourish with new vitality in modern society, and even build a regional brand culture.
