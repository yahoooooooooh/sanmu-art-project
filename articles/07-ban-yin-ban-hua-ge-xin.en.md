# 07-The Path of Fusion: The Innovative Trend of "Half-Printed, Half-Painted" in the Late Ming and Early Qing Dynasties

In its development over more than five hundred years, Gaomi Puhui New Year Pictures have not remained static but have undergone several important formal evolutions. Among them, the emergence of the "half-printed, half-painted" period marked Gaomi New Year Pictures' entry into a new stage of development.

This significant transformation occurred in the late Ming and early Qing dynasties. At that time, New Year picture artists faced several practical demands: firstly, traditional purely hand-painted Puhui New Year Pictures were time-consuming, so "speeding up the painting process and improving production efficiency" became a major consideration; secondly, with the growing public demand, "expanding thematic content to meet people's appreciation needs" also became increasingly urgent.

It was against this backdrop that wise New Year picture artists turned their attention to the more mature New Year picture techniques of surrounding areas. They actively absorbed and borrowed from "the woodblock printing technology of Yangjiabu in Weixian County" and "the strengths of woodblock New Year pictures from Yangliuqing in Tianjin," skillfully integrating them with the local Puhui New Year picture techniques of Gaomi.

Thus, a brand new production method emerged: first, the main outlines of the picture were printed using woodblocks, and then manual ink drawing and flat color application were carried out. This new method of "woodblock printing lines, hand-painting ink, and flat-coating colors" was the core of Gaomi's "half-printed, half-painted" technique.

This innovation brought significant results: "The speed of painting New Year pictures was greatly increased, the thematic content became richer, and many masterpieces with large scenes, multiple layers, and rich compositions appeared." The emergence of "half-printed, half-painted" was not only a liberation of Gaomi New Year picture productivity but also a leap in its artistic expression.
