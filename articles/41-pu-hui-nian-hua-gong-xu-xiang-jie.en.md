# 41-The Tempering of Over Twenty Steps: The Birth of a Gaomi Puhui New Year Painting

Gaomi Puhui New Year Painting, as one of the ancient and unique painting styles existing in the world, its charm lies not only in the final artistic effect presented, but more so in its unique, intricate, and detailed craftsmanship. An exquisite Puhui New Year painting, from the initial preparation to the final completion, requires careful polishing through over twenty major and minor steps.

According to the detailed accounts in the literature by Ge Hanqing and Ouyang Jubo, these steps can be roughly summarized as follows:

1.  **Burning Charcoal Sticks**: Selecting specific willow branches to burn into charcoal sticks for painting (see "The Secret of Willow Branch Charcoal Burning" in the previous article).
2.  **Shelling/Priming** (打壳子): (Specific meaning pending investigation, possibly refers to pre-processing of the painting paper or board, such as sanding or priming)
3.  **Sketching**: Using the burned charcoal sticks to draw the preliminary outline of the picture on paper.
4.  **Drawing with Ash**: Mixing fine ash from charcoal sticks with ink to draw more detailed outlines.
5.  **Pouncing Ash**: Covering the draft with the ash drawing over the painting paper and replicating the line drawing by pouncing.
6.  **Applying Ink Lines**: Officially outlining and shaping on the basis of the line drawing using ink lines.

21. **Raking Beard** (耙胡子): Meticulously depicting the beard of figures.
22. **Applying Clear Oil** (罩明油): After the New Year painting is finished, applying a layer of transparent protective oil (such as tung oil) to its surface, which serves to protect the painting, increase gloss, and prevent moisture and insects.
