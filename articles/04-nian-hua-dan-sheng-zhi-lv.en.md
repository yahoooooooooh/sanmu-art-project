# 04-More Than Just "Puhui": The Birth Journey of a Gaomi New Year Picture (Tradition and Improvement)

A Gaomi Puhui New Year picture, vibrant in color and spirit, undergoes a series of complex and meticulous processes from conception to final completion. It's not just about "Puhui"; it's a comprehensive art form that integrates painting, craftsmanship, and even some "secrets." Traditionally, its birth journey can be roughly divided into four main stages: drafting, hand-painting and coloring, face-detailing, and final finishing.

**I. Drafting: The Unique "Puhui" Method**

The creation of a New Year picture begins with a precise draft. Gaomi Puhui New Year Pictures employ their most representative **"Puhui" technique** in the drafting stage. In short, a master line draft is first meticulously drawn with special charcoal sticks and charcoal ash ink, and then it is transferred to new paper by dusting and rubbing, forming the base draft for subsequent hand-painting. This step lays the foundation for mass production and maintaining stylistic consistency of the New Year pictures. (For detailed principles, materials, and specific steps of the "Puhui" technique, readers can refer to the article in this series, "Why 'Puhui': Decrypting the Unique Identity and Core Craftsmanship of Gaomi New Year Pictures.")

**II. Hand-Painting and Coloring: Giving Life to the Artwork**

What is obtained from "Puhui" is merely a line draft. The true spirit and charm of the New Year picture come from the subsequent meticulous hand-painting and coloring. This is the most precious stage of Puhui New Year Pictures and the one that showcases the artisan's skill. Relying on experience and understanding of color, artisans use brushes to fill different parts within the line draft with vibrant colors. From the characters' clothing and accessories to the background pavilions, towers, flowers, birds, fish, and insects, every stroke is infused with the artisan's painstaking effort. Gaomi Puhui New Year Pictures use bold yet harmonious colors, exhibiting both the warmth of rich, heavy colors and the elegance of light, fresh tones.

**III. Face-Detailing: The Finishing Touch**

After all the colors are applied, the most crucial step is "face-detailing" â€“ meticulously painting the facial expressions and features of the characters. As the saying goes, "dotting the eyes of a painted dragon brings it to life"; face-detailing is paramount to shaping the character's image. The curve of the eyebrows, the opening of the eyes, the arc of the lips directly determine the character's emotions (joy, anger, sorrow, happiness) and overall temperament. Experienced artisans can imbue characters with vivid life with just a few strokes.

**IV. Finishing: Perfection and Presentation**

Finally, the New Year picture is "finished" and organized. This includes final embellishments of details on the picture, trimming the edges, and mounting it as needed (e.g., traditional scrolls, frames, or modern cardstock), so that it ultimately becomes a complete work of art, ready to enter thousands of households and adorn the Spring Festival.

**Improvement and Innovation**: It is worth mentioning that with the development of the times, the production techniques of Gaomi Puhui New Year Pictures are also constantly being explored and improved. For example, some artisans draw inspiration from the "half-printed, half-painted" characteristic of Tianjin Yangliuqing woodblock New Year pictures, attempting to combine woodblock printing with hand-painted Puhui in the line draft stage. Others explore the use of modern printing technology to assist in the production of some base drafts, to further improve efficiency and meet market demands while preserving the core value of hand-painting. These attempts are injecting new vitality into the inheritance and development of this ancient craft.
