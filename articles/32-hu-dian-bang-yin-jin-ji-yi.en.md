# 32-Hu Dianbang's Contribution: The Integration of Yangliuqing Techniques Spawns Gaomi's "Half-Print Half-Paint"

During the Jiaqing and Daoguang periods of the Qing Dynasty, the development of Gaomi New Year Paintings ushered in an important turning point â€“ the advent of the "Half-Print Half-Paint" era. The key figure in this transformation was an artist named Hu Dianbang, who brought the advanced techniques of Tianjin Yangliuqing New Year Paintings to Gaomi.

According to historical records, at that time, Hu Dianbang brought a New Year painting printing plate of "Tianxian Songzi" (Heavenly Immortal Sending a Child) from Tianjin Yangliuqing and settled in Lijiazhuang, Gaomi. Hu Dianbang did not simply copy the techniques of Yangliuqing, but "studied assiduously and integrated them," and soon skillfully incorporated the advantages and strengths of Yangliuqing's half-print half-paint New Year paintings into the creation of local Puhui New Year Paintings in Gaomi.

Through his efforts and innovation, he gradually formed the unique "Half-Print Half-Paint" production technology in the Gaomi area. This new technology, to a considerable extent, broke away from certain constraints of traditional purely hand-painted Puhui New Year Paintings, such as slow drawing speed and low output. The application of the half-print half-paint technology "greatly improved the production efficiency of New Year paintings" and also promoted the development of the local carving industry.

With the increasing proficiency in carving techniques and the manifestation of the advantages of half-print half-paint, this new form of New Year painting gradually expanded from the initial Lijiazhuang to many surrounding villages such as Beicun, Gongpomiao, Shilipu, Chengzi, Zhenjiatun, and Fanjiatun. It is clear from this that under the leadership of Hu Dianbang and the joint efforts of many artists, the development of Gaomi's half-print half-paint New Year paintings had reached a considerable level of prosperity at that time, laying a solid foundation for the subsequent development of Gaomi New Year Paintings.
