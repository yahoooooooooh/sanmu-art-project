# 57-Evolution of Flourishing Poku Hui New Year Paintings: From Workshop Rise to "Red Goods" Popularity

In its development process, Gao Mi Poku Hui New Year Paintings began to enter a relatively mature stage from the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty and continued to reach its peak during the Xianfeng period. The main标志 of this period was the emergence of workshops and painting shops, as well as the introduction of the "semi-printed and semi-painted" technique and the popularity of the "red goods" style.

**From Skill Accumulation to Workshop Production**:
After years of production experience accumulation, the technique of Poku Hui New Year Paintings became increasingly mature. In the fifteenth year of Qianlong (1750 AD), the Wang family in Gongpo Miao began to open workshops and accept apprentices (accepting four sons of the Zhang family in the same village as apprentices), which marked the inheritance of Poku Hui New Year Paintings moving from individuals to organized teaching. By the end of the Qianlong period, specialized New Year painting workshops and painting shops began to appear in the Gao Mi area.

**Commercialization and Subject Matter Expansion**:
The emergence of workshops and painting shops made Poku Hui New Year Paintings truly a commercial New Year art. To meet market demand, its subject matter scope was greatly expanded. The emergence of figure paintings depicting real life marked the development of Poku Hui New Year Paintings entering a mature stage, no longer limited to deity images and ink screen flowers.

**Innovation of "Semi-Printed and Semi-Painted" and the Leap in Color**:
During the Jiaqing period (around 1810), Poku Hui New Year Paintings began to enter the "semi-printed and semi-painted" period. The key figure in this change was Hu San, a woodblock carving apprentice from Tianjin Yangliuqing (who should be the same person or related person as Hu Dianbang mentioned earlier by Ge Hanqing; here the name in Wen Xin's text is used). It is said that Hu San was not valued in the Yangliuqing painting shop and later came to Gao Mi due to livelihood pressure, apprenticing under Hu Yuxian. He incorporated the characteristics of Tianjin Yangliuqing woodblock New Year Paintings into Poku Hui New Year Paintings, making the initial "poku hui" technique in New Year painting production partially replaced by woodblock printing, but still retaining the style of hand-painting and adding some elements of court paintings.
This innovation brought two major benefits:
1.  **Increased Efficiency**: Not only improved production efficiency.
2.  **Enhanced Artistic Effect**: More importantly, it made the colors of Poku Hui New Year Paintings begin to become vibrant, getting rid of the "dark" characteristic of the early period, and truly possessing the festive colors that New Year art should have.

**Two major schools**:
During the Daoguang period of the Qing Dynasty, Poku Hui New Year Paintings gradually matured after continuous development, finally reaching the peak of art. After absorbing various elements of sister arts, two major schools were formed: "Lao Mo Hua" (continuing the traditional ink wash style) and "Red Goods" (colorful New Year Paintings with bright colors). The coexistence and competition of these two major schools created a prosperous scene in the New Year painting market at that time, with a hundred schools of thought contending.
