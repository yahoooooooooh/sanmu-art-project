# 72-Gaomi's New Year Customs and Scenery: The Cultural Soil Nurturing Puhui New Year Paintings

The creation and prosperity of Gaomi Puhui New Year Paintings are inseparable from the strong New Year folk customs and cultural atmosphere of the local area. In Gaomi, the New Year is the grandest and most lively festival, and a series of rich and colorful New Year customs activities constitute a broad stage for the application of Puhui New Year Paintings.

*   **Laba Festival Starts the Year**: The "Laba Congee" on the eighth day of the twelfth lunar month kicks off the New Year festivities. As the saying goes, "After drinking Laba Congee, you count down to the New Year."
*   **Preparations Before the Year**: After Laba, every household steams steamed buns, dough fish (symbolizing abundance year after year), and rice cakes (symbolizing rising higher year after year). They also buy new bowls and chopsticks (symbolizing increasing family members) and make tofu (homophone for "all blessings"). Purchasing New Year paintings and pasting Spring Festival couplets are also essential steps, symbolizing saying goodbye to the old and welcoming the new.
*   **Minor New Year Offers Sacrifices to the Kitchen God**: On the twenty-third day of the twelfth lunar month, commonly known as "Minor New Year," every household offers candy and other items to the Kitchen God, sending him to heaven to report and praying for him to speak favorably before the Jade Emperor.
*   **New Year's Eve Stay Up**: On New Year's Eve, every family pastes New Year paintings and Spring Festival couplets. In the afternoon, they visit graves to pay respects to ancestors, and in the evening, they "welcome the God of Wealth." Afterwards, they hang "scrolls" (family altars) and set up offerings for sacrifices. The lights are bright all night, and people stay up all night, which is called "staying up to see the New Year in." At the fifth watch in the early morning, they eat vegetarian dumplings (with a coin wrapped inside, whoever eats it will get rich in the coming year), worship heaven and earth, offer sacrifices to ancestors, and younger generations kowtow and pay New Year greetings to elders.
*   **Spring Festival Greetings**: Starting from the first day of the New Year, people visit relatives and friends to exchange New Year greetings and blessings.
*   **Farewell to the Year Ceremony**: A "farewell to the year" ceremony is held in the early morning of the second or third day, during which the family altar is put away and the offering table is removed.
*   **Lantern Festival**: The Lantern Festival on the fifteenth day of the first lunar month is usually celebrated lively for three days in the Gaomi area (from the fourteenth to the sixteenth). Lantern fairs are held in urban and rural areas, every household hangs lanterns, accompanied by recreational activities such as singing Maoqiang opera, walking on stilts, and performing land boat dances.

These New Year customs, passed down through generations, are not only a manifestation of the spiritual homeland of the people of Gaomi but also provide rich creative themes and broad application space for Puhui New Year Paintings, making them an important carrier of local folk customs.
