# 56-Exploration of Early Poku Hui New Year Paintings: "Lao Mo Hua" with Literati Style and Traces of Water and Land Paintings

In its long development process, the early form of Gao Mi Poku Hui New Year Paintings showed some unique artistic characteristics, deeply influenced by various art forms such as literati painting, temple murals, and even water and land paintings.

**The Name and Style of "Lao Mo Hua"**:
Early Poku Hui New Year Paintings were locally called "Lao Mo Hua" in Gao Mi. The term "New Year Painting" ("Nian Hua") actually became popular gradually after Li Guangting's "Xiang Yan Jie Yi" in the Daoguang period of the Qing Dynasty. Before this, the names for these New Year posters varied in different places (such as "Hua Pian", "Wei Hua" in Beijing, "Hua Zhang" in Suzhou, etc.).
The works from the "Lao Mo Hua" period were mainly based on the themes of **deity images and ink screen flowers**. Their stylistic features mainly included:
*   **Literati Painting Charm**: With some meticulous brushwork or semi-meticulous and semi-sketchy style, which was related to some impoverished literati hand-painting New Year pictures for sale to make a living at that time.
*   **Emphasis on Ink, Light on Color**: More ink was used than color, and the overall tone was elegant.
*   **Sense of Ink Wash Freehand Brushwork**: Influenced by temple murals, except for the meticulous depiction of the figures' facial features and hands, other parts (such as clothing wrinkles, background) often had a sense of ink wash freehand brushwork, and the style appeared bold and ancient. As shown in the panel painting "Four Loves" (Figure 1-10), it is a more distinctive work of this period. The inscriptions and signatures on the ink screen paintings also brought vitality to the picture in terms of form.

**Absorption of Water and Land Painting Elements**:
Since the early Poku Hui New Year Paintings did not have a fixed mode, they broadly absorbed various available artistic styles. In addition to the potential influence of temple murals and Dunhuang murals, they also absorbed elements of **water and land paintings**.
Water and land paintings were important religious figure paintings used in Buddhist temples for water and land Dharma assemblies held to transcend the deceased, continuing from the Jin Dynasty to the Ming and Qing dynasties. They were a folk phenomenon produced under the background of the fusion of the three religions. Since early Poku Hui New Year Paintings borrowed from religious art such as temple murals to paint deity images, it was entirely possible to absorb some artistic elements from water and land paintings. Although it is difficult to find directly corresponding examples in existing works, works like "Thousand-Armed Guanyin" (Figure 1-11) are considered to have both characteristics close to water and land paintings and styles containing elements of Dunhuang murals.

These early explorations and diverse absorptions laid the foundation for the unique artistic style of Poku Hui New Year Paintings later on.
