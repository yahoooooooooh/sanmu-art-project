# 21-Detail Decryption of "Jia Tang" (Part 3): Figure Groups Outside the Courtyard and Their Orderly Arrangement

The depiction of figures in the "outside the courtyard" section of the "Jia Tang" New Year painting is one of the most lively and narrative scenes in the entire composition. The clothing, postures, and arrangement order of these figures contain specific cultural information and auspicious meanings.

**Figure Identity and Activities**: The main figures in the painting are usually dressed in elaborate official robes, indicating a certain social status. They are often accompanied by attendants. The figures' movements are varied and lifelike: young and middle-aged people are either conversing with each other or bowing, appearing polite; the elderly lean on canes, kindly watching over the children beside them; attendants carry lanterns or move gifts. These scenes together create a joyful atmosphere of kinship reunion and harmonious happiness during the festive period.

**Gender and Arrangement**: A notable feature is that the figures painted on both the left and right sides outside the courtyard are all male. In the arrangement order of figures, the rule of "young and middle-aged in front, elderly and young in the back" is usually followed. This arrangement has a dual meaning:
1. **Family Prosperity**: Expresses the beautiful expectation of "each generation excelling the last, and the family growing increasingly prosperous."
2. **Familial Bliss**: Also reflects people's yearning for a happy life with orderly seniority and shared familial bliss.

**Characteristics of Clothing**: In the depiction of figures' clothing, the figures on the left and right sides show different historical characteristics: "The figures on the left wear Ming dynasty clothing, and the figures on the right wear Qing dynasty clothing." This arrangement follows the historical sequence of "Ming first, then Qing," and also reflects the principle of "left as superior" in traditional Chinese etiquette (meaning the left side of the painting is considered more honorable).

**Attention to the Number of Figures**: The number of figures painted on both sides is usually an even number, such as four, six, or eight, the specific number depending on the size of the painting. In traditional Chinese culture, even numbers are considered auspicious, symbolizing being paired and good things coming in pairs.

These carefully arranged figure groups not only fill the painting with life but also convey rich concepts of clan ethics and beautiful wishes for the family's future through their specific arrangement and clothing.
