# 39-A Panorama of Folk Life: Five Major Subject Categories of Gaomi Puhui New Year Paintings

The content of Gaomi Puhui New Year Paintings can be described as all-encompassing. Their subjects are mostly drawn directly from the colorful secular social life and serve the broad masses of urban and rural laborers. These New Year paintings not only enrich and beautify people's material and spiritual lives but also play an important role in traditional ethical education and popularizing cultural knowledge.

According to the research by Ge Hanqing and Ouyang Jubo, the subjects of Gaomi Puhui New Year Paintings can be broadly categorized into the following five major types:

1.  **Deities Category**: This is the category most used in people's daily lives. Every New Year and festival, people worship ancestors and offer sacrifices to deities to pray for auspiciousness, wealth, and the protection of their ancestors. Common examples include portraits of the God of Wealth, the Kitchen God, and "Jiatang" (hanging scrolls), which are often "invited" (i.e., hung) as New Year paintings during the New Year festival to worship ancestors.

2.  **Wives and Children Category**: This type of subject primarily depicts family life, prayers for offspring, and other contents, full of beautiful aspirations for life. Examples include "Qilin Sending Son" (meaning getting a noble son) and "Lotus Giving Birth to People" (meaning many children and many blessings).

3.  **Opera Characters Category**: Putting widely circulated opera stories and classic characters on New Year paintings is a form popular with the public. Examples include New Year paintings created based on famous operas such as "Embroidery Shoe Story" and "Legend of the White Snake."

4.  **Figure Legends Category**: This type of subject has a wide range of content, including legends and stories of historical figures, literati, and scholars, as well as content advocating good deeds, punishing evil, and promoting filial piety. Examples include "Four Loves Picture" (depicting the elegant hobbies of four ancient scholars), "Qin Qi Shu Hua" (zither, go, calligraphy, painting), and "Lord Liu's Incognito Visit" (possibly referring to folk legends about the famous Qing Dynasty official Liu Yong). Among these, the famous "Twenty-Four Stories of Filial Piety" is a representative of this type of subject, used to admonish filial piety.

5.  **Landscape and Flower/Bird Category**: Depicting natural scenery, flowers, birds, fish, and insects, this type of subject has decorative and aesthetic value. Examples include "Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter" (seasonal flowers or landscapes), "Landscape Bamboo Fish," "Pine and Crane Picture" (symbolizing longevity), and "Phoenix Perching on Peony" (symbolizing wealth and auspiciousness).

In addition to the above five categories, some subjects depicting daily trivial matters and showing local customs are also widely circulated, such as "Aunts and Sisters-in-law Chatting" which depicts domestic life and the relationship between aunts and sisters-in-law, and "Kicking Shuttlecock" which depicts rural life and has a tranquil and serene mood. These rich and diverse subjects collectively constitute the colorful artistic world of Gaomi Puhui New Year Paintings.
