# 31-The Folk Art Style in Temple Murals: The "Side Hustle" of Puhui New Year Painting Artists and Artistic Homology

The inspiration for the artists of Gaomi Puhui New Year Paintings is deeply rooted in folk life. They have a thorough understanding of the pursuits, aspirations, loves, and dislikes of ordinary people. Therefore, their creations and production of Puhui New Year Paintings are deeply imprinted with the traces of real life.

Interestingly, the creative scope of these New Year painting artists was not limited to New Year paintings on paper. As the custom of people worshipping in temples such as "Guandi Temple" and "Tudimiao" was very prevalent at that time, many Puhui New Year painting artists also moonlighted as mural painters in the temples of various villages in Gaomi.

A vivid example is the "Guandi Temple" that still exists in Xiaomujia Village in the northwest countryside of Gaomi. The walls of the temple's three rooms are filled with fifteen vivid murals, including well-known Three Kingdoms stories such as "Sworn Brotherhood in the Peach Garden," "Riding Alone for a Thousand Miles," and "Battle with Huang Zhong." On the beams of the temple, "dragon and phoenix" patterns symbolizing auspiciousness are painted.

Ge Hanqing and Ouyang Jubo pointed out in their literature that the painting style of these temple murals is "exactly the same" as the art form of Gaomi Puhui New Year Paintings. This not only demonstrates the superb painting skills of the Puhui New Year painting artists and their ability to handle multiple themes, but also reflects from a side angle the close cultural connection between Puhui New Year Paintings and local religious beliefs and folk narrative traditions. In the hands of these folk artists, New Year paintings and temple paintings achieved a commonality and fusion of artistic style and expression techniques.
