# 68-Prospects for Rekindling Vitality: Exploring Future Development Paths for Puhui New Year Pictures

Despite the numerous challenges Gaomi Puhui New Year Pictures currently face, their unique artistic value and cultural heritage, as well as the collective efforts of various parties in recent years, also bring hope for their future revival and development. Wen Xin, in her research, proposes some constructive prospects for the future development of Puhui New Year Pictures.

**Leveraging Uniqueness and Enhancing Publicity**:
The uniqueness of Puhui New Year Pictures (such as the realism of figure modeling, the elastic skin texture of the powdered face technique, and the strong regional flavor) is its core competitiveness. However, because it exists only in Gaomi, its influence is relatively limited (unlike the four famous Chinese New Year Pictures, which are widely known). Therefore, **加大宣传力度** (increasing publicity) is an important means for its rapid revival.
*   **多渠道宣传** (Multi-channel Publicity): In recent years, the visibility of Puhui New Year Pictures has increased through cultural programs on CCTV, folk art exhibitions, and other channels.
*   **展览推广** (Exhibition Promotion): Touring exhibitions can be held in various places to increase public awareness and lay the groundwork for opening up a broader art market.

**Policy Guidance, Ensuring Inheritance and Innovation**:
Relevant government departments and institutions can introduce more specific and powerful protection and development measures:
*   **人才培养** (Talent Cultivation): In addition to protecting existing old artists, it is crucial to vigorously cultivate young talents, find potential trainees, and provide them with necessary economic support to form a scaled production and innovation team.
*   **产业化探索** (Industrialization Exploration): Boldly envision the corporatization of Puhui New Year Picture production and operation, forming a complete industrial chain from production and graphic design to the development of related derivative products. For example, the packaging of Gaomi's special large honey dates once incorporated graphic elements of Puhui New Year Pictures, which is a beneficial attempt. Through the income generated by Puhui New Year Picture related industries, art creation and inheritance can be supported, achieving a virtuous cycle of artistic and commercial aspects (as shown in 图6-1, urban sculpture with Puhui New Year Picture theme).

**Academic Development, Expanding Application Areas**:
The uniqueness of Puhui New Year Pictures gives it important academic research value.
*   **加强与高校的合作** (Strengthening Cooperation with Universities): Specialized links can be established with relevant universities to set up Puhui New Year Picture research institutes or university clubs, allowing more university students interested in folk art to learn about, study, and participate in the production and research of Puhui New Year Pictures. This is also an effective way of inheritance.
*   **跨界艺术创作** (Cross-disciplinary Artistic Creation): The graphic elements of Puhui New Year Pictures are not the product of a single culture. If its unique production techniques and visual style are applied as an art form to a wider range of artistic creation fields (such as modern painting, design, sculpture, etc.), it may evolve into more novel artistic forms and graphic designs.

**打造地域文化品牌** (Building a Regional Cultural Brand):
Under the protection of relevant national policies, the cross-pollination development of Chinese culture, and Gaomi's strong promotion of folk industries, Puhui New Year Pictures have the full potential to revitalize once again and surpass the previous "印刷上的繁荣" (printing boom) to achieve comprehensive progress.
In the long run, the graphic elements and artistic style of Puhui New Year Pictures are expected to penetrate into various fields such as packaging design, poster design, animation, and film and television, ultimately forming a cultural brand with distinct Gaomi characteristics and becoming the 代言 (daiyan - representative) of Gaomi culture.

Through the collective efforts of various parties, this ancient folk art treasure is bound to radiate even more brilliant light in the new era.
