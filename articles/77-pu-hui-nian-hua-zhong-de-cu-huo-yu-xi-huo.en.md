# 77-"Rough Work" and "Fine Work" in Puhui New Year Paintings: Artistic Stratification for Both Refined and Popular Tastes

In the development history of Gaomi Puhui New Year Paintings, in order to adapt to the needs of different consumer groups and the expression of different themes, artists gradually formed a production situation where "rough work" and "fine work" coexist, reflecting the relative "elegance" and "vulgarity" in their artistic creation.

*   **"Rough Work": Freehand Splashing, Focusing on Quantity and Speed**
    "Rough work" mainly refers to works quickly painted using freehand techniques such as "large splashes and wild strokes" in New Year painting workshops. These New Year paintings have a large output and are painted quickly, so their price is relatively cheap, which can meet the daily New Year needs of the general public. Their artistic style is more inclined to the inherent "xieyi" and "smearing" characteristics of Puhui New Year Paintings, which are simple yet full of life.

*   **"Fine Work": Meticulous Brushwork, Time-consuming and Laborious**
    "Fine work" refers to New Year paintings that are painted more meticulously, with many figures and complex compositions, such as family altar paintings and detailed images of civil and military gods of wealth. These works require more time and effort for meticulous drawing and painting, so their price is relatively expensive and are often favored by customers with higher aesthetic requirements.

This distinction between "rough work" and "fine work" is a flexible adjustment made by artists according to market demand and creative conditions. However, it is worth noting that even "fine work" is meticulousness within the overall "xieyi" tone of Puhui New Year Paintings, which is different from the meticulousness of pure gongbi paintings or academic styles.

Currently, some modern Puhui New Year painting creations unilaterally pursue the "elegance" of meticulousness and gorgeousness, which may gradually deviate from the folk art essence of traditional Puhui New Year Paintings, which is "elegance in vulgarity." This is a phenomenon that needs to be vigilant about in inheritance and development.
