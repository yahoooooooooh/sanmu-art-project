# 36-Collective Production in the 1950s: A Brief Revival of Gaomi New Year Paintings

Entering the 1950s, with the founding of New China and the development of the agricultural cooperation movement, the production situation of Gaomi New Year Paintings also underwent some new changes, and a brief revival appeared.

During this period, the production and operation mode of Gaomi New Year Paintings gradually shifted from individual or family units to organized collective production. There were three main operating methods:
1.  **Agricultural cooperatives investing in sideline production**: Agricultural production cooperatives invested capital and treated New Year painting production as a sideline occupation.
2.  **Mutual aid teams investing in sideline production**: Agricultural production mutual aid teams invested funds and organized members to engage in New Year painting production.
3.  **Joint ventures by individual households pooling funds for centralized production**: Several individual farmers联合起来, jointly pooled funds, formed New Year painting production groups, and carried out centralized production and sales.

Against this backdrop, New Year painting workshops were successively established in villages such as Dongfeng Village, Lijiazhuang, Mianhuatun, Beicun, Chengzi, Fanjiatun, Gaojiazhuang, Lijiazhangcun, Dongqianling, and Sunjiakou in the Gaomi area. These workshops were usually managed by the village's production brigade cadres, implementing a model of collective production and collective sales.

Through this organized production method, the production of Gaomi New Year Paintings was improved and restored to a certain extent, and it once "flourished again." Its products were mainly sold to surrounding areas such as Dongfeng Village, Xiazhuang, Jiaozhou, and Jiaonan, and could still be sold far to the three provinces of Northeast China, still holding a place in the market.

However, this revival was relatively short-lived, and in the subsequent historical period, Gaomi New Year Paintings would face new challenges.
