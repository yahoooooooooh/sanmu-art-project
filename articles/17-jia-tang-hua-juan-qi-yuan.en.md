# 17-The Birth of "Family Shrine" Scrolls: From Physical Ancestral Tablets to Remembrance on Paper

The "Family Shrine" (Jia Tang) theme in Gaomi Puhui New Year paintings did not appear out of thin air; its formation is closely related to population migration in Chinese history and the evolution of ancestral worship customs.

According to historical records, during the Hongwu reign of the Ming Dynasty, due to years of war and natural disasters that led to a sharp decline in the population of the Central Plains, the imperial court organized large-scale migrations from Shanxi to Shandong and other areas. These immigrants, who had left their homes, placed ancestral tablets in their home halls for worship to commemorate their ancestors.

However, as time went on, families grew, and the number of deceased ancestors increased. The limited space in the main halls could no longer accommodate the large number of physical ancestral tablets. To solve this problem, resourceful people came up with a new method: they drew the likeness of the tablets on paper and then wrote the names of deceased family members on these paper "tablets." During New Year and other festivals, this paper "Family Shrine" would be taken out for veneration. This was the initial prototype of the "Family Shrine" painting.

Later, to cater to market demand and public aesthetics, artists began to artistically enhance these simple paper tablets. They added rich decorative elements such as figures, plants, and buildings to the paintings. Through generations of artists' continuous creation and refinement, the initially simple paper tablets gradually evolved into the content-rich and complexly composed "Family Shrine" New Year paintings we see today.
