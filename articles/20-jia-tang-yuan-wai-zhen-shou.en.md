# 20-Decoding the Details of "Family Shrine" (II): Guardian Stone Lions and Evergreen Trees Beyond the Courtyard

Among the many elements in the "Outside the Courtyard" section of the "Family Shrine" (Jia Tang) New Year painting, the stone lions guarding the gateway and the trees that span the picture also carry rich cultural symbolic meanings.

**Guardian Stone Lions**: On both sides of the main gate in the painting, a stone lion is usually depicted. In traditional Chinese culture, lions are regarded as auspicious beasts that guard homes and ward off evil, so ancient prominent families often placed a pair of stone lions in front of their gates. Literature indicates that stone lion sculptures from the Ming and Qing dynasties in China were relatively docile in appearance and were mostly configured as a male on the left and a female on the right, in pairs. The male lion was often depicted playing with an embroidered ball, while the female lion was often shown caressing a cub. However, in the "Family Shrine" paintings, although the stone lions retain the relatively docile morphological characteristics of the Ming and Qing periods, the gender distinction does not seem strict; "there is no distinction between male and female, both have forepaws playing with an embroidered ball, symmetrically arranged." This might be a simplification or conventionalized treatment in the expressive form of New Year paintings.

**Trees Spanning the Painting**: On the left and right sides of the painting, a tall tree is usually depicted, its height almost spanning the entire canvas.
*   **Mostly Pine Trees in Modern Times**: In contemporary "Family Shrine" paintings, these two trees are usually depicted as pine trees. Due to their characteristic of remaining green throughout the seasons and withstanding frost, pine trees are endowed with the auspicious meaning of "everlasting," symbolizing that the family will prosper for generations. When artists paint these two pine trees, they often "improvise by hand," resulting in "completely different and myriad postures" for the two trees based on different creative ideas and expressive techniques, showing variation within symmetry.
*   **Early "Left Locust, Right Pine"**: It is noteworthy that in early "Family Shrine" paintings, the configuration of the trees was not two pine trees but "a locust tree on the left and a pine tree on the right." This "left locust, right pine" layout is closely related to the history of Shanxi immigrants during the Hongwu reign of the Ming Dynasty. It is said that the government office handling immigration affairs at that time was located at the Guangji Temple north of Hongtong City in Shanxi. Near the temple was a huge ancient locust tree revered by the local people as a divine tree; it was a landmark of Hongtong County. Therefore, immigrants to Shandong, in order to commemorate their hometown and ancestors, painted this symbolically significant large locust tree into the "Family Shrine," forming the specific "left locust, right pine" format.
*   **Loss of Cultural Connotation**: The authors of the literature criticized this phenomenon, believing that "most contemporary artists ignore its origin and, merely to achieve better visual effects, change all locust trees to pine trees, which is unreasonable." This change, while possibly easier to handle visually, also causes the "Family Shrine" painting to lose some of its important historical and cultural connotations.

These stone lions and trees outside the courtyard are not merely decorative elements of the painting but also vivid embodiments of family beliefs, historical memories, and hopeful expectations.
