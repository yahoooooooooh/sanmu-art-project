# 51-Gao Mi Poku Hui New Year Paintings from the Perspective of Field Survey: The Joy of Inheritance and the Predicament of the Market

Wen Xin, in his research on the visual graphics of Gao Mi Poku Hui New Year Paintings, attaches great importance to field work. Through visiting local cultural centers, art academies, New Year painting production areas (such as Jiangzhuang) and New Year painting sales shops in Gao Mi, and communicating with artists, scholars and ordinary people, he gained some vivid understanding of the current situation of Poku Hui New Year Painting inheritance and market response.

**Efforts in Inheritance and Accumulation of Data**:
The author saw exquisite original Poku Hui New Year Paintings in the cultural center and took photos as research data, which shows that relevant institutions have made certain efforts in data preservation and display. The official introduction also provides researchers with accurate conceptual definitions.

**Current Situation of Market Sales**:
The investigation found that although there are many sales points of Poku Hui New Year Paintings in the Gao Mi market, **there are no specialty stores that solely sell Poku Hui New Year Paintings**. Most are mixed sales with other folk art products such as the "Gao Mi Three Uniques" (Poku Hui New Year Paintings, paper cuttings, clay sculptures).

**Contradiction between Innovation and Recognition**:
In terms of graphic design innovation, a prominent problem is:
*   **Traditional styles still dominate**: Most of the Poku Hui New Year Paintings sold in the market, and those that the public are more willing to buy, are still traditional, classic styles.
*   **Few innovative excellent works, low recognition**: The number of truly innovative excellent Poku Hui New Year Paintings is small, and these new patterns are often not widely recognized by the market.
*   **Brand effect and fixed thinking**: The local people in Gao Mi have "very strong fixed thinking". They are more inclined to buy "classic works" and widely praised (such as those that have appeared on CCTV) New Year painting styles, believing that these are "good things", which are prestigious whether for personal use or as gifts. Works with new patterns are easily considered "cheap products made in private workshops" and are difficult to gain brand recognition.

This phenomenon reveals the market challenges faced by Poku Hui New Year Paintings in the process of inheritance and innovation: how to effectively innovate on the basis of maintaining traditional essence and gain consumer acceptance and preference is an urgent problem to be solved.
