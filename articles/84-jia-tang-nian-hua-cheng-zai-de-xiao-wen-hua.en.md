# 84-Jiatang New Year Pictures: A Folk 重器 (Important Artifact) Carrying Filial Piety Culture and Family Bloodline

Among the many themes of Gaomi Puhui New Year Pictures, "Jiatang" (also called "zhouzi" locally) is undoubtedly the one most closely integrated with folk customs and carrying the deepest cultural implications. It is not only an important item for New Year sacrifices but also a symbolic representation carrying filial piety culture and maintaining family bloodlines.

**Folk Function of Jiatang**:
Jiatang painting is an indispensable part of the Lunar New Year's Eve family sacrifice ritual in the Gaomi area, used to replace the old custom of placing ancestor tablets for worship. Its size is usually large, its content is rich, and its structure is generally divided into three parts: the upper part shows the ancestor couple sitting in the main hall, the middle part shows children playing in the courtyard, and the lower part shows the family members symbolizing lineage. Jiatang often has grids left for filling in the names of family members, also serving as a family tree. A Jiatang painting can be used for decades until the grids are filled before being replaced, and it is regarded as a precious family possession.

**Concentrated Embodiment of Filial Piety Culture**:
The core cultural implication of Jiatang painting is "filial piety." Hanging Jiatang and sacrificing to ancestors is a direct manifestation of the concept of filial piety in the traditional family culture of the Chinese nation, which is based on agricultural civilization. This reverence for ancestors and identification with family bloodline contains strong national cohesion. Even during special historical periods, the folk worship of Jiatang was never completely interrupted, showing its deeply rooted cultural gene.

**Integration of Art and Folk Customs**:
Due to its complex content and large size, pure hand-painted Jiatang paintings are expensive, so they are often made using semi-printed and semi-painted or woodblock block printing methods. Even hand-painted Jiatang often uses symmetrical composition to improve efficiency. Its solemn and dignified artistic style complements the atmosphere of the ancestor worship ceremony.

In today's Gaomi, Jiatang painting is still an indispensable part of the New Year customs. It transcends ordinary decorative New Year Pictures and becomes an important cultural carrier connecting the past and the present and maintaining family feelings. It is the category of Gaomi Puhui New Year Pictures that truly still performs its core New Year custom mission.
