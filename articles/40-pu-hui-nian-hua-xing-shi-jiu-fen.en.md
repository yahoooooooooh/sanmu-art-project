# 40-Folk Customs in Hanging and Pasting: Nine Practical Forms of Gaomi Puhui New Year Paintings

Gaomi New Year Paintings are not just works of art; they are also closely linked to the local folk life. According to their different positions of hanging and pasting and their varying specific folk functions, Gaomi New Year Paintings can be roughly divided into nine main practical forms or types:

1.  **Door Painting Category**: That is, New Year paintings pasted on the main door. Different contents and meanings of door paintings, such as Qin Qiong and Yu Chigong, and Shen Tu and Yu Lei, will be pasted according to the position of the door (such as the main door, room door, inner door, etc.) and the different identities of the residents.

2.  **Window Top, Window Side Category**: New Year paintings used to decorate around windows. People are accustomed to decorating the four sides of windows with auspicious flower patterns. There are sayings in the folk about common window side patterns, such as "East Lotus, West Peony," symbolizing auspiciousness and beauty.

3.  **Zhuo Wei Zi (Table Skirts)**: Mostly used during festivals. In front of the offering table for worshipping ancestors and the God of Wealth, a New Year painting with auspicious patterns (table skirt) is used to cover the front, making the room appear more tidy and beautiful, and also adding a sense of solemnity.

4.  **Da Gua Zi (Large Hanging Scrolls)**: This is a large-sized New Year painting, about three feet long and with a painting scroll. It is mostly hung in women's rooms, and its subjects are mostly from the "Wives and Children" series, such as "Mother and Child Learning to Read," "Mother and Child Winning First Place," and "Dancing Child," expressing good wishes for family harmony and virtuous descendants.

5.  **Kang Tou Hua (Kang Head Painting)**: That is, New Year paintings pasted on the wall at the head of the heated brick bed (kang) in northern folk houses. Their content mainly includes chubby babies (meaning many blessings and many children) and opera stories, such as "Year After Year Abundance" (painting a baby holding lotus root or fish) and "Mu Guiying Taking Command."

6.  **Zhuzi (Jiatang / Da Ying)**: This is an important form of New Year painting, mainly used for worshipping ancestors during the New Year. It is usually mounted in a scroll form, hence called "Zhuzi," and its core content is "Jiatang." There is another form of "Zhuzi" called "Da Ying," which may refer to a Jiatang painting with richer content or larger size.

7.  **Pei Zhu (Da Hua)**: This is a set of two New Year paintings, usually with related or symmetrical auspicious patterns, mainly used for hanging on both sides of the "Zhuzi" (Jiatang) to decorate and enhance the atmosphere, hence also called "Da Hua."

8.  **Deity Image Category**: Mainly various deity portraits used for New Year sacrifices and prayers. Includes common portraits of the God of Wealth (can be subdivided into three types: Second Hall God of Wealth, Martial God of Wealth, and Civil God of Wealth), "Shen Ma" (also called "Jia Ma" or "Zhi Ma," a small piece of paper printed with a deity image, used for burning to invite the deity), and "Zao Ma" (Kitchen God, a small horse is usually painted above the picture, which is cut out and burned during the Small New Year, indicating sending the Kitchen God to heaven).

9.  **Zhuozi Tou (Table Head)**: This type of New Year painting is usually hung in unused rooms, mainly for decorative purposes. Its subjects are mostly festive and auspicious flower and bird patterns, such as "Phoenix Perching on Peony."

These nine different forms of New Year paintings are fully integrated into the New Year customs and daily lives of the people of Gaomi and are important carriers for studying the local folk culture.
