# 45-Secrets of Styling (Part 1): The "Powdered Face" and Physical Characteristics of Figures in Puhui New Year Painting

Gaomi Puhui New Year Painting is not only unique in its production process, but its figure styling also has distinct characteristics, full of strong local flavor and unique aesthetic taste.

**The Visual Focus and Flesh-like Quality of the "Powdered Face"**:
Puhui New Year Painting is most meticulous and characteristic in the treatment of figures' faces. Artists, when drawing faces, first apply a white powder base to form a white face shape, which is called "powdering the face" (like theatrical makeup). Then, on this basis, they meticulously outline the eyebrows, eyes, and facial features, apply light colors, and finally apply clear oil.

This treatment makes the figures' faces particularly prominent, with clear features, and possessing a translucent, delicate, and elastic "flesh-like quality" rarely seen in other folk New Year paintings. For example, the images of beautiful women in works like "Two Beauties" and "Kicking Shuttlecock," with their lotus-like powdered faces, tender and expressive eyes, slightly closed red lips, and faint blush on their cheeks, all benefit from this technique of "careful powdering of the face, skillful drawing of eyebrows and eyes," shaping vivid and lifelike female figures.

**Coexistence of Fullness, Roundness, and Delicacy**:
From the overall image of the figures, since Puhui New Year Painting usually does not focus on the meticulous depiction of the background, and often even omits it, the main figures are more prominent. The facial styling of figures often shows the characteristics of "plump ears and large cheeks." Within this fullness and roundness, a sense of delicacy can be cleverly brought out.

**Unique Body Proportion: Long Upper Body, Short Lower Body**:
A very significant characteristic in the body proportion of figures in Gaomi Puhui New Year Painting, which is rare in other painting styles, is "long upper body, short lower body." This body type may not conform to people's aesthetic preference for tall and slender figures in real life, but in Puhui New Year Painting, this unique styling forms a specific artistic mode and serves the expression of emotion.

For example, in the representative work "Aunt and Sister-in-law Chatting," the lower body of the younger sister-in-law is only about one-third of her body length. It is precisely this seemingly "disproportionate" short lower body that just right expresses the dynamic of the aunt and sister-in-law leaning closely together and walking slowly, as well as the intimate emotional atmosphere, making the entire work "come alive."

These unique styling techniques collectively constitute the distinct mark of Gaomi Puhui New Year Painting in figure shaping.
